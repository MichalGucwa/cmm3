=============== Below are things that need to be fixed on neighborhood level ==================
4. algorithm to selectively expand for first coordination sphere up to 2.6-3 angstrom to tolerate bigger coordinate error (done)
7. Not sure about this one, but Ivan want to use W2P instead of 2WP (done, new field which_wBRP2 introduced)

=============== Below are things that need to be fixed on individual entry level ==================
3. merge 8 ribosome entries into 4 entries 4a1c set (We decided to skip these structures completely)
1. remove 8 structures EM, NMR, all that left has to be X-ray structures with resolution better than 4.5 angstrom 
8. use only RNA structures, remove DNA structures (~ 1400 structures total)
2. update dataset to December of 2012 (default behavior)

=============== Below are things that need to be fixed on database level ==================
6. decrease Qe threshold to 0.5, Qv also 0.5, Qs still kept as 0.64

=============== Below are things that has been fixed ==================
5. include O4' as a separate class in initial analysis, make sure O4' is in motif analysis -- fixed, it is actually O3'/O5' not included in BNR, BNR2 originally
