INTRODUCTION

For a protein crystal, diffracting to about 2.0 A resolution (or lower), 
the number of observations is comparable to the number of parameters to 
be determined. This requires additional information to be introduced on 
the basis of a priori knowledge of protein stereochemistry. Such 
information is usually provided as a set of interatomic distances and/or 
angles, planarity, van der Waal's radii, etc. as restraints and is derived 
from structures of small molecules and peptides. The most recent library 
is the set of bond distances and angles with their standard deviations 
generated from the Cambridge Structural Data Base (Allen, Kennard & 
Taylor, 1983) by Engh & Huber (1991), henceforth EH.

Here the use of the EH parameters in the form of a computer-readable 
library for the CCP4 version of the PROTIN/PROLSQ package (Konnert
and Hendrickson, 1980; CCP4, 1979) is described.
 
METHODS

The EH parameters are not completely self-consistent. For example in
the planar phenyl ring of the tyrosine side chain the angles do not sum
exactly to 360 degrees (there are small rounding errors: the sum of three 
bond angles around CG atom is 359.7 degrees, around CZ is 360.1 degrees). 
Thus the EH set does not exactly represent the ideal structures of the 
amino acid residues. The simplest way to overcome this problem is to use 
the existing PROTIN/PROLSQ dictionary and match it by least-squares
minimisation to the EH set for each residue. Conditions for planar
groups should be introduced as constraints.

There is a problem with proline, arising from the fact that
the main chain parameters for this residue differ from those for other
residues in the EH set. This indicates that proline requires a separate
definition for its main chain. Apart from proline all other dictionary
entries are geometrised with only marginal roundoff error of 0.001 A
corresponding to the precision of the EH values. 

Recently there was a parallel attempt to implement the EH parameters in
a computer-readable form (Priestle, 1993). However, the dictionary
generated by Priestle suffers from some discrepancies from the EH
set. These concern C-CA-CB angles for all groups as well as angle
distances for some side chains. This introduces for some atoms an 
additional r.m.s. error of about 0.01 A, comparable to the r.m.s. 
deviation in distances usually obtained for highly refined protein models.
