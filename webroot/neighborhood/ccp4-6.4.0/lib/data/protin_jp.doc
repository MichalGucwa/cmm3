               DICTIONARIES FOR REFINEMENT OF PROTEINS


      The dictionary PROTIN.DIC has been updated by John Priestle with the 
"best" bond length and bond angle parameters as determined by an exhaustive 
search of the small molecule Cambridge Structure Database (Engh and Huber 
(1991) Acta Cryst. A47, 392-400).  Where possible, their sigma values have
also been included.  Only protein parameters have been updated and only those 
for bond lengths and bond angles.
      Note that the frame of reference for the standard main chain has also 
been changed. The parameters (coordinates) for NFORMAL and NACETYL are 
unchanged, but have been rotated into this new frame of reference. Likewise, 
the coordinates for heame, sugars, ions, etc. have been left unchanged.
      This dictionary was constructed for v210. However, Victor Lamzin pointed 
out that there were inconsistances in some bond angles. Below is a private 
communication which addresses this problem. The revised dictionary is in v213.

      Victor Lamzin (EMBL, Hamburg) has pointed out to me that the dictionary
for PROTIN/PROLSQ that I wrote to use the Engh & Huber parameters had some
minor inconsistencies some of the angle parameters.  Checking them carefully,
I found that indeed some problems are present.  These arose because I had to
convert the E&H parameters first to coordinates via FRODO.  The angles between 
atoms at branch points (like C and CB at CA) are not defined in FRODO, but
rather come from the pseudo-torsion angles.  These are always 0 or 180 at 
trigonal atoms, and +/- 120 at tetrahedral atoms.  It turns out that these
also need to be altered (by trial-and-error) slightly to put the branched atom
at the right place.  This was done for the FRODO and O dictionaries, but after
I had created the PROTIN dictionary.  I have rewritten, yet again, the PROTIN 
dictionary "protin.dic" from the CCP4 suite and will send it to you for
inclusion in future releases of the CCP4 suite.

     John has also written dictionaries for: TNT, FRODO, O, and XPLOR.
