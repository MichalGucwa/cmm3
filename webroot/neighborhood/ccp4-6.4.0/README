1) You can move the unpacked binary bundle to any location you like,
   but the paths should not contain spaces.
2) Run the script BINARY.setup. This script asks you to accept the licence,
   checks for common problems and adjusts paths in several files.
   
If you would ever like to move this directory to a different location,
re-run the BINARY.setup script.

Before you start using the CCP4 suite from the command line,
source bin/ccp4.setup-sh (in bash/dash/zsh shells)
or bin/ccp4.setup-csh (in csh/tcsh shells). This adds a few directories
to the PATH and sets several other environment variables.

Please report problems to ccp4@ccp4.ac.uk.
