<h2><a name="project"></a>1a) Setting up Project and Directory Aliases</h2>

<p>The <strong>Main Window</strong> of CCP4i looks like:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/mainwindow.png" alt="Main Window of CCP4 Interface" width="805" height="338" /></p>

<p>It is composed of windows, menus and buttons. The most important of
these are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The gold-coloured bar at the top displays a help message, which will
also be displayed in a "bubble" when the mouse rests on a particular part
of the interface. The HELP button on the right opens the documentation pages.
Help can also be obtained for a specific entry widget by right-clicking
on the mouse.</li>
<li>The left-hand side of the main window is concerned with selection of
jobs to run. The <strong>choose module</strong> pull-down menu is used
to select the <strong>module</strong>. For each module, there is a
list of <strong>tasks</strong> and <strong>folders</strong>. Folders are
used to group related tasks within a module, and can be opened or closed
by clicking on the title bar. Tasks can be selected by clicking on one.
Modules, folders and tasks are described further in the
<a href="#mtzformat">next section</a>.</li>
<li>In the centre of the main window is the
<strong>Job List</strong>, with a list of the jobs run via CCP4i.
The status of the job (<font color="#009900">STARTING</font>,
<font color="#009900">RUNNING</font>,<font color="#009900">FINISHED</font>,
<font color="#009900">FAILED</font>) is shown. Jobs
can be selected and deselected by clicking on the relevant line in the
job list. Clicking the right-hand mouse button in the job list window
presents a menu of actions that can be performed on the current selection.</li>
<li>On the right-hand side at the top there is the
<font color="#009900">Directories&amp;ProjectDir</font> button. This opens
a window for setting directories, and choosing the current project, see
<a href="intro-tutorial.html#project">tutorial 1a</a>.</li>
<li>The <font color="#009900">View Any File</font> button can be used to
select and view any file using the <strong>The FileViewer Utility</strong>, for
example to view an MTZ reflection file.</li>
<li>Then there are a number of <strong>Database Options</strong>.
To use these, you must first select a job from the job list.</li>
<li>Next there are a number of <strong>Configurations Options</strong>.
For example, you can specify non-CCP4 programs to be used.</li>
<li>The <font color="#009900">Mail CCP4</font> button allows you
to send a message (comments, questions, problems) to the Interface
developer. The message will be mailed immediately when
<strong><tt>SEND</tt></strong> is pressed.</li>
<li>The <font color="#009900">Exit</font> button exits the Interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="mtzformat"></a>1b) Introduction to the MTZ format</h2>

<h3>Modules, folders and tasks</h3>

<p>CCP4i will run most frequently used programs from the CCP4 suite,
but is organised around the idea of <strong>tasks</strong> rather than
programs. Usually one task corresponds to one program but sometimes
more than one program may be required to perform a task or a program
may be used in different tasks.</p>

<p>The tasks are grouped into <strong>modules</strong> according to
the stage in the crystallographic process they are used in
(<em>e.g.</em> Density Improvement and Refinement are two separate
modules). There are also utility modules which contain tools
which apply to the three main types of data (<em>i.e.</em> Map &amp;
Mask Utilities, Reflection Data Utilities and Coordinate
Utilities), and for graphics, viewing and Clipper. Then there is the Program
List, which contains an alphabetical list of all the CCP4 programs represented
in CCP4i.</p>

<p>Tasks may be further grouped into <strong>folders</strong> within a
module. These are used to group together sets of tasks which may perform
similar functions, or which are otherwise related to each other.</p>

<h3>MTZ file format</h3>

<p>CCP4 reflection data is held in MTZ files. MTZ files are <b>binary</b>,
<em>i.e.</em> they cannot be viewed with the <tt>more</tt> command or with
an ASCII viewer. However, they can be easily listed at the command
line with:</p>

<dl>
<dd>&gt; <font color="#ff0000">mtzdmp foo.mtz</font></dd>
</dl>

<p>See CCP4 documentation for options to <tt>mtzdmp</tt>. Within
<tt>CCP4i</tt>, MTZ files can be viewed by clicking on a
<font color="#ff0000">View</font> button next to the file name or
by selecting the file from <font color="#ff0000">View Any File</font>
or <font color="#ff0000">View Files from Job</font>.</p>

<p>MTZ files consist of 2 parts:</p>
<ol type="i">
<li>Reflection data is held as a
sequence of records; each record holds structure factor amplitudes,
phases, etc. for one set of hkl indices. For <b>merged</b> MTZ files,
each set of hkl indices occurs only once in the file. For <b>unmerged</b>
MTZ files, there may be more than one occurrence of a set of hkl indices.</li>
<li>There is also a file <b>header</b> which holds global information, such
as spacegroup, cell dimensions, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MTZ columns</h3>

<p><strong>Records</strong> of reflection data in the MTZ format may hold any number of
pieces of data. Equivalent pieces of data in different records are
referred to as <strong>columns</strong>:</p>

<pre>

                   column
                     |
                     |

    0   0   2      626.00    112.00      3.00
    0   0   4     9111.00    168.00     22.00
    0   0   6      513.00    146.00     20.00     --- record
    0   0   8     2610.00     52.00     10.00
    0   0  10         ?         ?       11.00
    0   1   1     1200.00     38.00     13.00
    0   1   2     2244.00     55.00     21.00
    0   1   3     2163.00     36.00      6.00
    0   1   4     6057.00     82.00     13.00
    0   1   5     3698.00     46.00     16.00

</pre>

<p>The columns are given names in the MTZ file header so that they
can be identified:</p>

<pre>

  * Column Labels :
 
    H K L FP SIGFP FreeRflag

</pre>

<p>When running the programs directly, these names are used in the
LABIN keyword:</p>

<pre>

  LABIN F=FP SIGF=SIGFP FREE=FreeRflag

</pre>

<p>The names before the = sign are the names that appear in the program
documentation. The names after the = sign are the names that appear
in the file.</p>

<p>In CCP4i, these column assignments are made via pull-down menus,
after the MTZ filename is entered.</p>

<p>The header contains more information which is useful for organising your data.
For instance, each column has a defined type. For the above example, the types are:</p>

<pre>

  * Column Types :

    H H H F  Q     I

</pre>

<p>Column Types are used to provide an extra check that the user input assignment for a
requested program label is of the correct type. For more information, see
<a href="#coltypes">COLUMN TYPES</a>.</p>

<p>The main file header also contains &quot;dataset&quot; properties.
The columns of data are grouped into distinct &quot;datasets&quot;. For
example, a measurement and its standard deviation must be part of the same
dataset. All information about a derivative makes up one data set distinct
from the equivalent columns for the native which may also be present in the file.
A dataset is identified by a &quot;project name&quot;, which specifies a particular
structure determination, a &quot;crystal name&quot;, which is essentially a single
crystal form, and a &quot;dataset name&quot;. Normally, all datasets in a file
will have the same &quot;project name&quot; and different &quot;dataset names&quot;.
Each dataset will have its own cell dimensions and wavelength. Dataset information
comes into its own for <a href="../../../html/harvesting.html">Data Harvesting</a>.
For more information on project, crystal and dataset names, see
<a href="../../../html/mtzformat.html">MTZ FORMAT</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="coltypes"></a>COLUMN TYPES</h3>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt>H</dt><dd> index h,k,l</dd>
<dt>F</dt><dd>structure amplitude, F</dd>
<dt>J</dt><dd>intensity</dd>
<dt>D</dt><dd>anomalous difference</dd>
<dt>G</dt><dd>member of Friedel pair, F+ or F-</dd>
<dt>K</dt><dd>member of Friedel pair, I+ or I-</dd>
<dt>Q</dt><dd>standard deviation of J,F,D or other</dd>
<dt>L</dt><dd> standard deviation of F+ or F-</dd>
<dt>M</dt><dd> standard deviation of I+ or I-</dd>
<dt>P</dt><dd> phase angle in degrees</dd>
<dt>W</dt><dd> weight (of some sort)</dd>
<dt>A</dt><dd> phase probability coefficients (Hendrickson/Lattman)</dd>
<dt>B</dt><dd> BATCH number</dd>
<dt>Y</dt><dd> M/ISYM, packed partial/reject flag and symmetry number</dd>
<dt>I</dt><dd> any other integer</dd>
<dt>R</dt><dd> any other real</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is essential to have correct column types for PHASES and ANOMALOUS differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>to distinguish phases which will require changing if the reflection is moved to a
symmetry equivalent;</li>
<li>anomalous differences which require changing sign if the reflection is changed to
a Friedel pair.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition two special data types are used to signal that you are preparing data for translation functions of various types. They are:</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>U</dt><dd>partial FC</dd>
<dt>V</dt><dd>partial PHIC</dd>
</dl>
