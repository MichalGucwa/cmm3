These example files are intended as a starting point for users to set 
up their own scripts and also as a tutorial on how to run the programs.
Some examples use a single program, others carry out a more complex
procedure involving the use of several programs. 

These examples are not directly runnable because the necessary
data files are not distributed. We try to keep these up-to-date,
but they are not so readily tested as those in $CEXAM/unix/runnable
If in doubt, consult the program documentation.
