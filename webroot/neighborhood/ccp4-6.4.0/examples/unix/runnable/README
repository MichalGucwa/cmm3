These example files are intended as a starting point for users to set 
up their own scripts and also as a tutorial on how to run the programs.
Some examples run a single program, others carry out a more complex
procedure involving the use of several programs. 
 
Before trying to run examples in this directory, you'll need to make
sure you have run na4tomtz.sh and completedata.sh in the $CEXAM/toxd directory 
to create the necessary .mtz files there. See the $CEXAM/toxd/README file.

The executable files have a .exam suffix when there would otherwise be a
name clash with the binaries. 

All the examples should be runnable, although other examples may need 
to be run first to create appropriate input files. Usually a message 
is output to tell you what to run first but if the example complains 
of a missing input file, grep through the rest for an output file of 
that name.  The scripts aren't supposed to write files in this directory, 
and you should find all input files on an absolute path in terms of 
the environment variables CCP4_SCR and CEXAM.

These programs are mainly to illustrate how to run the programs,
but may not always be the best example of the functionality of the programs.
