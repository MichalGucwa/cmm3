# Example of creating a search model for solving 1mzr.
# The template for the search model (XYZIN) is chain A
# of 1a80. The file ALIGNIN contains the alignment
# between the target sequence of 1mzr and the sequence
# of the template, in PIR format. XYZOUT contains the
# template structure modified according to the CHAINSAW
# procedure.
