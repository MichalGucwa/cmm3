Some notes on the examples directories here (they may contain their
own README files):

* rnase: data files for Ribonuclease example

* toxd: data files for alpha-dendrotoxin example

* tutorial: CCP4 tutorials using the graphical user interface "ccp4i"

* unix/runnable: unix scripts using the rnase/toxd data which should
  actually run

* unix/non-runnable: unix scripts without usable input data, e.g. for
  image processing and reduction
