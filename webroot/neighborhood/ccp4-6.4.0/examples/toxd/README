        Test Data from crystals of dendrotoxin from green mamba.
        --------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains data obtained from Tadeusz Skarzynski:

  TI: CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE OF ALPHA-DENDROTOXIN FROM THE GREEN MAMBA VENOM AND
      ITS COMPARISON WITH THE STRUCTURE OF BOVINE PANCREATIC TRYPSIN-
      INHIBITOR    
  AU: SKARZYNSKI_T
  JN: JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, 1992, Vol.224, No.3, pp.671-683

The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank - entry 1dtx.
However the native reflection data in toxd.mtz are not that actually used for
the final refinement. The file here only contains data to 2.3Ang

Target sequence:
QPRRKLCILH RNPGRCYDKI PAFYYNQKKK QCERFDWSGC GGNSNRFKTI EECRRTCIG
Molecular Weight:
7071 Da

The reflection file is also in Ian Tickle's na4 format.  To convert to mtz use:

1) na4tomtz.exam - this creates the basic MTZ file toxd_old.mtz

2) completedata.exam - this introduces Missing Number Flags, completes
                     the dataset and adds a free-R column, giving
                     the file toxd.mtz

The majority of example scripts use the latter file, toxd.mtz (e.g.
they assume a free-R column is already present).

Update: The MTZ file is now distributed, but it is still useful to go through
the above procedure.

Examples can be found in the directories $CEXAM/unix/runnable,
$CEXAM/unix/non-runnable and $CEXAM/vms. The scripts have been hacked at Daresbury, 
particularly to use the approved `sh' rather than `csh'. Some example output 
files are given (*.log-dist). The examples that used to be in $CEXAM/toxd
have been removed since they were out-of-date.
