  Test Data from crystals of ribonuclease from Streptomyces aureofaciens
                               (RNAse SA).
        --------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains data obtained from J.Sevcik:

TI: Ribonuclease from Streptomyces aureofaciens at atomic
    resolution
AU: Sevcik_J, Dauter_Z, Lamzin_VS, Wilson_KS
JN: ACTA CRYSTALLOGRAPHICA SECTION D-BIOLOGICAL CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,
    1996, Vol.52, No.Pt2, pp.327-344

The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank - entry
1rge. There is a more recent model refined against cryogenic 1.0A 
data - entry 1lni.

Target sequence:
DVSGTVCLSA LPPEATDTLN LIASDGPFPY SQDGVVFQNR ESVLPTQSYG
YYHEYTVITP GARTRGTRRI ITGEATQEDY YTGDHYATFS LIDQTC
Molecular Weight:
10576 Da

Data is available to 2.5A, 1.8A and 1.15A. The data here are 
2.5A (native and 3 derivatives) and 1.8A (native and 2 complexes).

The reflection file is available in Ian Tickle's na4 format.  To convert to mtz use:
 
1) rnase_na4tomtz.exam - this creates the basic MTZ files rnase18_old.mtz and
                         rnase25_old.mtz

2) rnase_completedata.exam - this introduces Missing Number Flags,
                      completes the dataset and adds a free-R column,
                      giving the files rnase18.mtz and rnase25.mtz
 
The majority of example scripts using this data use the latter files,
(i.e. they assume a free-R column is already present).

Update: MTZ files are now distributed, but it is still useful to go through
the above procedure.
