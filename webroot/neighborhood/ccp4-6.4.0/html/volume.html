<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
In its present version the VOLUME program determines the
volume of a polyhedron surrounding the selected atom or atoms when the
polyhedral faces are determined by one of three procedures based on
the Voronoi construction. A general description of these procedures, 
the differences between them and which one is likely to be of use in a 
particular situation are described below.
<P>
<I>NB: On some systems (e.g. some Digital/Compaq machines) there may be
a system program also called <TT>volume</TT>, and this name clash may lead
to problems trying to run the CCP4 version of VOLUME (depending on the
value of your <TT>PATH</TT> environment variable). If you encounter this
problem then try using the full path e.g. <TT>$CBIN/volume</TT> to specify
the correct version.</I>  
<h2>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</h2>
<h3>Input file</h3>
The program requires a formatted file as input - logical name
XYZIN . It is written to accept the output file from the SURFACE
program directly. This will be the normal input because of the KEY
selection procedure described below. The file will be processed as
follows:

<p>
All header material will be disregarded. The program searches each
line for the starting characters 'BEGIN '. If found, the program then
reads into the appropriate arrays the atom data starting on the
following lines in the format:
<p>
 (1X,I2,7X,I2,1X,I2,1X,2A4,1X,I3,3F8.3,2F5.2,2F6.1,F5.2)
<p>
The arrays filled are:
<pre>
 KEY(I)     = atom processing flag. see below
 NUMCHN(I)  = chain number if more than one
       peptide in input file (not used
       in this program)
 NUMFIL(I)  = file number if more than one
       protein is listed in input file
       (not used in this program)
 ATM(I)     = atom designation. 1 to 4
       characters (use BNL system)
 RES3(I)    = residue designation (three letter
       code)
 SEQNUM(I)  = sequence number of residue
 X(I)       = X coordinate of atom
 Y(I)       = Y coordinate of atom
 Z(I)       = Z coordinate of atom
 RVDW(I)    = van der Waals radius of atom
 RCOV(I)    = covalent radius of atom
 AAREA      = accessible area of atom in
       file from ACCESS.
 CAREA      = contact area of atom in
       file from ACCESS.
 FRCACC     = fractional accessibility of
       atom in file from ACCESS.
       (These dummy variables are
       not used in this program.
       Kept in list as reminder)
</pre>
Note that the maximum value for I is the number of atoms in the input
list. (These may be protein atoms, 'heteroatoms', and/or water molecules
depending on the file used.) You must ensure that the array dimensions
in the VOLUME program are large enough no only to accommodate this list
but also to hold the output of SHELL (see below). The relevant arrays
are dimensioned through the parameter MAXATM which appears in the file
VOL.CMN. Check this value and edit as required.
<p>
<h3>Output files</h3>
The output of the program is provided in two files.  The successful
calculations are put into a file designated as local name XYZOUT. The
format of this file is:
<pre>
 SUMMARY INFORMATION
BEGIN
 (followed by data records in the following format)
       (2I5,2I3,2A6,I5,3F8.3,2F5.2,F8.3,I5)

 NCALC     = Number of atom in this output list
 I         = Serial number of atom in full coordinate
   list
 NUMCHN(I) = Chain number (see INPUT)
 NUMFIL(I) = File number  (see INPUT)
 ATM(I)    = Atom designation - 1 to 4 characters
 RES3(I)   = Residue designation - 3 letter code
 SEQNUM(I) = Residue sequence number
 X(I)      = X coordinate of atom
 Y(I)      = Y coordinate of atom
 Z(I)      = Z coordinate of atom
 RVDW(I)   = van der Waal's radius of atom
 RCOV(I)   = Covalent radius of atom
 VOLUME    = Volume of atom as calculated by 
   specified method
 NS        = Number of solvent shell positions used
   in defining the limiting polyhedron
</pre>
The second file, local name ERROUT, contains any error messages that
may have been generated during the operation of the program.  If
serious errors are encountered the calculation for that atom is
aborted (VOLUME and NS are both set equal to 1000), error messages
listed, and the calculations continued with the next atom in the list.
Occasionally less serious errors are found, the messages are listed,
but the calculation is continued. The decision on whether or not to
keep the result is made by the investigator.  Normally, the cause of
the problem can be identified, corrected and the calculation rerun.

<h2>KEYWORDED INPUT</h2>

<h2>PROGRAM FUNCTION</h2>
After reading the input file, the next step is to surround the 
protein with a hypothetical
'solvent' shell which serves to define the volume of the surface atoms
on the protein. The positions assigned to these 'molecules' are loaded
onto the end of the protein atom file. They are used to define the
limiting polyhedron, but, except in the case of cavity calculations,
they are not used as centers for volume calculations themselves. This
layer is set up by the subroutine SHELL.
<p>
The program then cycles through each atom in turn whose volume is to
be calculated (as designated by the KEY array).
<p>
  a) The Subroutine FILBOX selects all atoms within a defined radius
which might contribute to the limiting polyhedron surrounding the
target atom.  Potential defining planes of this polyhedron are
perpendicular to the interatomic vectors between the target atom and
the atoms in this list. The position of these planes along the vectors
will depend on the procedure for calculation chosen at the time of
program initiation. FILBOX sets up these planes and loads then into
the array BOX in the order of increasing distance from the target
atom.
<p>
  b) The Subroutine ATMPOL examines the list BOX and selects those
planes which actually make up the limiting polyhedron. It computes the
coordinates of all the vertices of the polyhedron and stores these
coordinates, and the vertex identification numbers, in the arrays
POLYHN AND IPOLYH. This is the heart of the program and its most
complex component.
<p>
  c) The Subroutine POLVOL examines the arrays POLYHN and IPOLYH and
computes the volume of this limiting polyhedron.
<p>
  d) The program then cycles through a), b) and c) until the atom list
has been completed.
<h2>PROGRAM DETAILS</h2>
 A) INPUT ARRAY KEY(I):
 The KEY array is normally set up in the SURFACE program
but it can be hand edited or supplied otherwise.

 KEY(I) = -1  Atom I is omitted entirely from all 
       calculations.
 KEY(I) =  0  Atom I is included as part of the 
       protein and its volume is calculated.
 KEY(I) =  1  Atom I is included as part of the 
       protein and is thus used in defining
       the polyhedra, but its volume is not
       calculated.
<p>
(The (-1) value can be used to asses the affect of a particular atom
or atom group on the volume available to surrounding atoms without any
other change in the program, for example.) Only the atoms of interest
need have their volumes calculated.  If the SURFACE program is used to
generate the input file, these atoms can be selected on the basis of
atom name, residue name, residue sequence number, or individually by
serial number in the coordinate list.
<p>

 of the four 3x3 unique 
 determinants are returned.
<p>
DET3R For the 4x3 array A, the values   None
 of the four 3x3 unique
 determinants are returned.
<p>
         C) SUBROUTINE SHELL
<p>
 Positions in a cubic lattice, ICL, just outside of, but
adjacent to, the protein atoms are identified.  These will serve to
define the protein surface for the purpose of the volume calculations
as described later.  In principle, there is no particular restriction
on the size of the lattice, although the calculated volumes of the
surface atom will depend to some extent on the lattice dimensions.  In
the current version, the default value of the lattice edge is 2.8 A
giving a cube which is about 3/4 of the volume occupied by a water
molecule.  The uncertainty in the eventual Voronoi volume increases
with lattice size while the computation time increases rapidly as the
lattice size is decreased.
<p>
 The size of the lattice, ICL, in the three dimensions is made
larger than the protein so that there are at least two empty cubes in
each direction outside of the protein.  The protein atoms are then
loaded into the lattice positions.  With the default size about half
of the lattice positions that contain any protein atom contain only a
single atom.  A few cubes contain as many as five atoms.  When the
loading is complete each entry in the array ICL contains either 0 or a
positive integer.  The latter is an index to a location in the array
JSERN.  That entry in JSERN gives the number of following positions in
JSERN that contain the serial numbers of the atoms whose centers are
located in the lattice cube identified by the ICL array index.
<p>
 The entire array ICL is now checked.  All positions whose 26
nearest neighbors are not protein-containing locations are loaded with
the flag -1.  These positions represent bulk solvent remote from the
protein.
<p>
 Of the remaining positions containing 0s some may be inside
the protein and represent potential cavities.  These are identified as
positions which have among their 26 neighbors one or more pairs of
opposing positions both of which contain a protein atom(s).  Such
positions are loaded with the flag -2.
<p>
 At this point both the 0 ad -2 lattice positions, while not
containing any protein atoms, may have the cube center inside the van
der Waals envelope of a protein atom.  This is checked and any solvent
(i.e. 0) positions so found are flagged -3, and any such -2 positions
are shifted to -4.  The -3 and -4 positions are not considered further
in this program but are flagged should the need arise to refer to
them.  The remaining 0 and -2 positions are now both empty and outside
the van der Waals envelope of the protein.
<p>
 In most calculations the -2 positions will be disregarded and
the space that they represent is assigned to the protein.  The
positions labelled 0 are all face, edge or corner connected to
themselves and to cubes containing protein atoms.  They thus form a
connected envelope around the protein.
<p>
 If SHELL the final contents of ICL will be listed in the
output file on LUN2.  The three dimensional array is sectioned
perpendicular to Z (K index).  The X axis (I index) is horizontal and
Y (J index) vertical.
<p>
Each lattice position is labelled with -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 or 
**, the last for protein containing positions.
<p>
         D) SUBROUTINE FILBOX
<p>
 This subroutine is entered with the identity and coordinate of
the target atom whose volume is to be calculated.  Its location in the
ICL lattice is established as are the 26 surrounding cubes which would
contain the relevant 'solvent' positions, if any.
<p>
 The coordinate file is then checked and all atoms whose
centers are within the selected distance, ARANGE, of the target atom
are loaded into the arrays TEMP and ITEMP.  Any of these atoms which
are 'solvent' positions have their distance adjusted such that the
Voronoi plane to be drawn will be tangent to the van der Waals sphere.
This group of atoms is now loaded into the array as BOX and IBOX in
order of their increasing distance from the target atom.
<p>
 At this point the serial number in the coordinate lists of the
atom and a code to indicate whether it is a 'solvent' shell position
or not is contained in IBOX.  In BOX the distance to the target atom
is located in BOX(1,I) and the X, Y and Z components of this distance
in BOX(2,-4, I).  The latter represents the interatomic vector and are
the direction components of the normal to the Voronoi plane.  This
plane is completely defined by specifying the point where it
intersects the interatomic vector.
<p>
 One of three procedures is chosen to define this point of
intersection.  In the original Voronoi procedure the plane bisects the
interatomic vector.  In Richards' method B the ratio of van der Waals
or covalent radii of the atoms are used.  In the radical plane
procedure only the van der Waals radii of the atoms are used whether
they are covalently connected or not.  The details of these procedures
are discussed in Appendix A.
<p>
 The final section of FILBOX loads into the highest index
positions of BOX, four hypothetical planes surrounding the target
atom.  These represent a very large tetrahedron which is simply used
as a starting point for the interactive determination of the limiting
polyhedron by the next subroutine.
<p>
         E) SUBROUTINE ATMPOL
<p>
 This subroutine operates on the contents of the array BOX and
loads the arrays POLYHN and IPOLYH with the vertex positions and
identifications of the developing polyhedron.  Each vertex represents
the point of intersection of three planes.  The X, Y, Z coordinates of
this point are placed in POLYHN.  The vertex is identified by the three
planes, each of which, in turn, is associated with a particular atom
surrounding the target atom.  For the purpose of this subroutine,
these atoms are identified by their index in the array BOX.  The
vertex can thus be identified by three such indices.  These indices
are stored in IPOLYH.  The initial set of 4 vertices are produced from
the large tetrahedron loaded in positions 97-100 in BOX.
<p>
 ATMPOL then starts checking each plane in BOX to see if it
forms part of the limiting polyhedron.  This is accomplished by
examining each vertex with respect to the plane.  If the vertex is on
the same side of the plane as the target atom, then it remains part of
the polyhedron.  If the plane separates no vertices from the target
atom, then it is not part of the polyhedron and is disregarded.  If
the plane does separate one or more vertices, then this vertex or
vertices are discarded and the new vertices produced by the plane are
added to the list.  This last operation is the most complex.
<p>
 For this purpose, the vertices are identified as the
intersection of three lines (the array LINES), rather than three
planes.  Each line represents the intersection of two of the planes
that form the vertex.  Each line is represented by an index pair.
When a vertex is eliminated, the three lines that identify that vertex
form 3 new vertices through their interaction with the new plane.
When more than one vertex is removed by a single plane, it is
necessary to keep track of which lines are kept and thus form new
vertices with the plane.  Some lines will be eliminated completely,
that is they do not intersect the plane within the region of interest.
<p>
 As each plane is tested, the polyhedron is unaffected or made
smaller.  The total number of vertices generally increases but varies
erratically during the computation.  Normally by the end of the
calculation less than one half of the entries in BOX actually are used
to define the limiting polyhedron.  This indicates that the limit has
indeed been reached, and that no other atoms in the structure, which
have not been explicitly examined, would contribute to the polyhedron
if tested.
<p>
         F) SUBROUTINE POLVOL
<p>
 This subroutine takes the contents of POLYHN and IPOLYH and
calculates the volume of the limiting polyhedron.
<p>
 The vertices of each face have one index in common, the index
that identifies the atom associated with the face normal. All index
pairs in IPOLYH that contain that common index are collected.  The
other pair of indices associated with each vertex are then arranged in
sequence to define the perimeter of the face. The face is then divided
into triangles with a common apex at one vertex. The volume of the
tetrahedra formed by these triangles and the target atom at the center
of the polyhedron are then calculated and summed.  This procedure is
repeated for each face of the polyhedron yielding, finally, the total
volume.
<p>
 It might be noted here that if one wishes to draw one or more
of the polyhedra with a graphics program, the necessary data can be
obtained from this subroutine. The coordinates of all the vertices are
contained in POLYHN and the subroutine orders the vertices in the
sequence in which the vectors would be drawn.
<p>
ADDENDUM
<p>
 The volume of the -2 positions provided by SHELL may be
calculated separately, treating these positions as additional "protein
atoms". Note that such calculations, of course, will change the volume
calculated for adjacent protein atoms. No van der Waals radius is
assigned to these positions.  The defining planes are drawn tangent to
the surrounding protein atoms. The "cavity" volume so calculated is
only a crude approximation to the real void space because of the
coarseness of the lattice used.  (See: F.M.Richards, Carlsberg
Research Communications 44: 47-63 (1979)).  This option has NOT been
activated in this version of the VOLUME program.
