<H1> MAPDUMP (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>mapdump </b>
- print a dump of sections of a map file
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>mapdump mapin</b>
<i>foo.map</i>
<br>
        [input line]
<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>

<tt>mapdump</tt> gives an ASCII dump of part or all of a binary map file,
specified on the command line with logical name <B>mapin</B>. 
Map header information is listed first, see <a href="maplib.html">library
documentation</a> for full description of this. Then map data is listed
as a sequence of sections. Each section is divided into pages, each of which
contains a maximum of 25 columns. The length of each page is the number
of rows in the map grid. Map data are given as the value held in the
file multiplied by a scale factor and taken to the nearest integer. The scale
factor may need to be adjusted to give useful output.
<p>
The program reads three numbers on standard input in free format: the
first and last section numbers of the map to be printed and the scale
factor by which to multiply the contents. The default (obtained with input of `/') 
is to print the first section at unit scaling.  An immediate end-of-file on
the input causes the program to print only the map header (no sections).
Any of the keywords 'RUN' 'GO' or 'END' can be used instead of the
end-of-file to start the program running.
