<H1>SORTMTZ (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2>NAME</H2>
<B>sortmtz </B>
- Sort a MTZ reflection data file

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P><B>sortmtz hklout</B> <I>foo_out.mtz</I> [ <B>hklin</B> <I>foo_in.mtz</I>
] <BR>
[<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>]<BR>
list of hklin files </P>

<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>The program SORTMTZ is used to sort and combine standard or multi-record
type MTZ reflection data files on up to 5 keys in either ascending or descending
order to the output file HKLOUT. </P>

<H2><A NAME="data_control"></A><A NAME="keywords"></A>DATA CONTROL CARDS</H2>

<P>When using the program control data is expected from standard input
in the FIXED order given below (please note that the END keyword is
<b>not</b> supported for SORTMTZ): </P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="ascend"></A>[ ASCEND | 0 ] | [ DESCEND | 1]</DT>

<DD> Specifies whether to sort in ascending (ASCEND or 0) or descending
(DESCEND or 1) order. This record is OPTIONAL and sorting will default
to ASCEND if it is not given. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="vrset"></A>VRSET <em>magic_num</em></DT>

<DD> Reset the value of the internal representation of Missing Number Flags
to be <em>magic_num</em>. <em>magic_num</em> must be an integer. By default
SORTMTZ uses -999999 as the internal representation, however it is possible
that some programs (e.g. MOSFLM) can produce numbers which are smaller. In
these cases VRSET should be used.</DD>

<DT><A NAME="sort_keys"></A>SORT KEYS</DT>

<DD> These are the labels for up to 5 sort keys to be used. Extra keys
after the first five items will be ignored. This flag is OPTIONAL if HKLIN
is assigned on the input and will default to H K L in this case. It is
COMPULSORY if HKLIN is not assigned. The keys are specified in decreasing
order of significance. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="filenames"></A>&lt;filenames&gt;</DT>

<DD> The rest of the input data are the filenames to be used for input,
one filename per line. If HKLIN is assigned on input then these lines are
ignored. </DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="files"></A>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<P>The input files are the reflection data file(s) to be sorted in standard
MTZ format. If HKLIN is assigned then only this file is used for input,
otherwise the names of the input files are read as described in section
DATA CONTROL CARDS. </P>

<p>If there is more than one input MTZ file, the header from the first
input file is used as the basis for the output file. For unmerged
files (a.k.a. multi-record files) the order of the symmetry operators in
the MTZ file header is significant since it is used to determine the
ISYM value in the M/ISYM column. This order needs to be consistent
across all files, since only the first order is retained in the output
file. SORTMTZ checks for this consistency and exits if there is a problem.
In that case, run the input files through <a href="reindex.html">REINDEX</a>
with the SYMM keyword set to the file spacegroup, and the operators
and ISYM values will be set to the standard order. </P>

<P>For the purposes of sorting the missing number flag is temporarily altered
to a large negative number. The columns H, K and L should never have a
missing number flag, so this will only have an effect when sorting on other
columns. The program will abort if there is a datum that is more negative
than this temporary missing number flag. Note that in a multi-record file
there should be no missing reflections. </P>

<P>The output file is the sorted reflection data in MTZ format. The missing
number flag for the output file will be the same as that for the first
input file or the default NaN. The missing number flags for the input files
need not necessarily be the same. </P>

<H2><A NAME="output"></A>PRINTER OUTPUT</H2>

<P>The printer output gives the following information (not necessarily
in the order given): </P>

<OL>
<LI>The names of the sort keys </LI>

<LI>The sort order (ascending or descending) </LI>

<LI>Details from the opening of the input and output reflection data files
</LI>

<LI>Details of the header information for each file opened. </LI>

<LI>The number of reflections read and written. </LI>
</OL>

<H2>ERROR MESSAGES</H2>

<DL>
<DT>SORTMTZ cannot find file:</DT>

<DD> You have given a filename that the program could not find. The name
of the file is also printed. </DD>

<DT>SORTMTZ cannot find some labels in MTZ file:</DT>

<DD> There is a mismatch between the sort keys you have specified and the
column labels found in the input file. It also displays a list of sort
keys and the position found or `not found'. </DD>

<DT>SORTMTZ has detected a different number of columns in this file compared
to the first file:</DT>

<DD> A mismatch between two input files with different numbers of columns.
</DD>

<DT>SORTMTZ has detected different column types: </DT>

<DD>You must ensure that you combine the same sort of data together from
different files <EM>e.g.</EM> F with Fs and SIG with SIGs. This is checked by comparing
the column types. This does not preclude merging different data types as
R and I just define real and integer numbers. </DD>
</DL>

<P>The messages below are errors detected from the return value of the
sort routines. They will prevent SORTMTZ from continuing but the error
should be sought in the sort routines themselves.</P>

<DL>
<DT>SORTMTZ failed to initialise sort:</DT>

<DD> An error was detected using the sort begin (SRTBEG) routine. A status
number is also given. </DD>

<DT>SORTMTZ failed to release record to sort procedure:</DT>

<DD> An error was detected in the sort release (SRTRLS) routine. </DD>

<DT>SORTMTZ detected failure in merge phase of sort procedure:</DT>

<DD> An error was detected using the sort merge (SRTMRG) routine. </DD>

<DT>SORTMTZ detected error on obtaining record from sort procedure in return
phase:</DT>

<DD> An error was detected using the sort release (SRTRET) routine. </DD>
</DL>

<H2>FURTHER INFORMATION</H2>

<P>The program SORTMTZ was developed from the program SORTLCF in a workshop
in Cambridge in May, 1991. The move from LCF to MTZ files is part of the
cunning CCP4/EACBM master plan to improve the software for protein crystallography.
