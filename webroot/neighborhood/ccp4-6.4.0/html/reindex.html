<h1>REINDEX (CCP4: Supported Program)</h1>
<h2>NAME</h2>
<p><b>reindex</b>
- produces an MTZ file with h k l reindexed. There are options to
change the symmetry, and to reduce the reflection to the (new) asymmetric unit.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p><b>reindex hklin</b>
<i>foo_in.mtz</i>
<b>hklout</b>
<i>foo.mtz</i><br />
[<a href="#keywords">Keyworded input</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Reindex reflections and/or change symmetry and/or reduce to asymmetric
unit again. The input file may be:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>an unmerged (multirecord) file, in which the operations are
carried out on the original indices (reconstructed using the M/ISYM
column of HKLIN), or</li>
<li>a merged file (one record per reflection), in which only
reindexing is allowed. The file should not contain phase or phase
coefficient columns: these will be left unchanged, and will probably be
wrong. If the reflection indices are reduced to the asymmetric unit
(default unless <a href="#noreduce"> NOREDUCE</a> is specified), then
any anomalous difference columns will be negated, and F+/- I+/- columns
swapped, if the hand of the index is changed by the reduction process.</li>
</ol>

<p>This program is useful, for example when:</p>
<ol>
<li>you have unmerged integrated data, which will need to be reduced to the asymmetric unit
after reindexing, <em>e.g.</em> <b>mosflm</b>.</li>
<li>you have unmerged data, and you want to change to a different point group.
This will have a different definition of the asymmetric unit.</li>
<li>you have merged data which needs to be reindexed, <em>e.g.</em> you might want to
change h,k,l to k,h,-l in a tetragonal system. Beware, not all
reindexing is appropriate, and the program does no check (<em>e.g.</em> reindexing
l,h,k is invalid for a tetragonal crystal).</li>
</ol>

<p>The program operates on each reflection in turn, without sorting them.
Therefore, the output file will normally need to be resorted before further 
use (see <a href="cad.html">CAD</a> or <a href="sortmtz.html">SORTMTZ</a>).
For the reindex option, the new unit cell is determined and written to
the output file. For unmerged data, the orientation data (cell and Umat)
are also updated for all batches.</p>

<p>The following operations are carried out on each reflection:</p>
<ol>
<li>If unmerged data (multirecord file): reconstruct original indices</li>
<li>Reindex if requested</li>
<li>Reject reflections with non-integral indices</li>
<li>(Optionally) reduce reflection to asymmetric unit, using new
symmetry (if different). 
Anomalous difference, F+/- and I+/- columns will be corrected as
necessary, <em>i.e.</em> if the hand of the index is changed by the
reduction process.</li>
</ol>

<p>Subkeywords HKL or AXIS (default HKL) followed by a transformation.</p>
<p>The transform can be given a similar way to symmetry operations (see below for
examples).</p>

<dl>
<dt>Subkeyword <b>HKL</b></dt>
<dd>
  <dl>
  <dt><pre>reindex HKL   k, h, -l</pre></dt>
  <dd>implies h<sub>new</sub> = k<sub>old</sub>, k<sub>new</sub> = h<sub>old</sub>,
      l<sub>new</sub> = -l<sub>old</sub>
      <em>i.e.</em> this defines a matrix to reindex the reflection data, such that
      <pre>     [hn kn ln]          =  [ho ko lo] [M]</pre></dd>
  <dt><pre>reindex HKL   k, h, -l</pre></dt>
  <dd>generates a reindexing matrix:
  <pre>     [M] =  [ 0  1  0]
            [ 1  0  0]
            [ 0  0 -1]</pre></dd>
  <dt><pre>reindex HKL   h, -k, -h/2-l/2</pre></dt>
  <dd>would generate a matrix:
  <pre>     [M] =  [ 1.0  0.0  0.0]
            [ 0.0 -1.0  0.0]
            [-0.5  0.0 -0.5]</pre></dd>
  <dt><pre>reindex HKL   h-1, k, l</pre></dt>
  <dd>would result in all h indices being reduced by 1.</dd>
  </dl><br />
</dd>

<dt>Subkeyword <b>AXIS</b></dt>
<dd><p>If the program <a href="axissearch.html">AXISSEARCH</a> has been used to find
possible alternative reciprocal axes, the reindexing matrix can be specified in
terms of reciprocal axes, for example:</p>
  <dl>
  <dt><pre>reindex AXIS   a*+c*,c*,-b*</pre></dt>
  <dd>implies a*<sub>new</sub> = a*<sub>old</sub>+c*<sub>old</sub>,
  b*<sub>new</sub> = -c*<sub>old</sub>, c*<sub>new</sub> = -b*<sub>old</sub>
  (which is in fact equivalent to <tt>reindex HKL h,l-k,-k</tt>)</dd>
  <dd><pre>    If     [a*new] = [M]**-1 [a*old]
           [b*new]           [b*old]
           [c*new]           [c*old]

    Since   [hn kn ln] [a*n]    =  [ho ko lo] [a*o]
                       [b*n]                  [b*o]
                       [c*n]                  [c*o]

      [hn kn ln] [M] **-1 [a*o] =     [ho ko lo] [a*o]
                          [b*o]                  [b*o]
                          [c*o]                  [c*o]

    and     [hn kn ln]          = [ho ko lo]  [M] as before</pre></dd>
  </dl><br />
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Cell dimensions will be recalculated for the redefined cell.
Be careful that the index transformation preserves the hand of the axes (unless
you want to invert the hand), <em>i.e.</em> that the matrix has a positive
determinant.  If it does invert the hand, the program will change the sign of
all reindexing elements unless
the keyword <a href="#lefthand">LEFTHAND</a> is present.</p>

<p>If the transformation 
leads to fractional indices for some cases (as in the 2nd example above), these
reflections will be rejected.  
<!--EJD  Could this ever happen? !-->
If the reindexing operations include
translations, then the orientation data in the output file will not be
strictly correct.</p>

<h3><a name="match"></a>MATCH</h3>
<p>In some complicated cases it is easier to specify how three new reciprocal
vectors should be matched onto three old ones. The program <a href="axissearch.html">AXISSEARCH</a> allows 
you to check reciprocal vector lengths and angles, and you may wish to 
convert a P1 cell say to one which approximately matches a C2 one with 
angles approximately 90 degrees. The program can deduce the reindexing matrix from
this information.</p>
<pre>    match   2h'=h +k -l  * 2k'= -h +k + l * 1l'= 1h</pre>

<h3><a name="symmetry"></a>SYMMetry &lt;spacegroup_name | spacegroup_number | symmetry operations&gt;</h3>
<p>For unmerged files, set new symmetry for reduction to asymmetric unit 
(after optional reindexing). Defaults to input symmetry from HKLIN file. New symmetry 
is written to the HKLOUT file. If the output symmetry is a lower symmetry,
then all input reflections will output, but there will be a lower completeness over
the asymmetric unit. If the output symmetry is a higher symmetry, then all input 
reflections will output, with more observations per h k l set.</p>
<p>For merged files, new symmetry is written to HKLOUT but reduction to 
asymmetric unit is turned off. This option is therefore not advisable for
merged data, unless you know what you are doing. </p>

<h3><a name="lefthand"></a>LEFTHAND</h3>
<p>Allow the reindexing transformation to invert the hand (EXTREMELY
unwise unless you are very sure you know what you are doing!). Anomalous differences will
NOT be altered by a reindexing operation inverting the hand.</p>

<h3><a name="noreduce"></a>NOREduce</h3>
<p>Do not reduce merged reflections to asymmetric unit after reindexing.
Reflections in unmerged files are always reduced to the
asymmetric unit defined by the (new) symmetry.</p>

<h3><a name="end"></a>END</h3>
<p>Terminate control input, also done by end-of-file.</p>
