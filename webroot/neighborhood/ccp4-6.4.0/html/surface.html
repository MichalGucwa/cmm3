<H1> SURFACE (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>surface </b>
- surface accessibility program and for preparing input file to program volume.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>surface xyzin1</b> <i>foo_in1.pdb</i>
[<b>xyzin2</b> <i>foo_in2.pdb</i>]
<b>xyzout</b> <i>foo_out3.rad</i>
<br>
<A HREF="#keywords">[Keyworded input]</A>

<H2><A NAME="description"></A> DESCRIPTION</H2> 

For each atom in a list, the accessibility program is designed to find
the surface area in square Angstroms that is accessible to a probe
sphere of a radius specified by the user. The program requires atom
identification data and crystallographic coordinates from an input
file. This will normally be in Brookhaven PDB format, but the program
will also accept the output file from the Konnert-Hendrickson
refinement program, or a file produced internally during operation of
this program (see <A HREF="#format">FORMAT</A>). The program
can be easily modified to accept other formats. 
<p>
Atom types are
identified through residue and atom names. Van der Waals radii are
assigned to each atom on the basis of atom type. The values are listed
in the subroutines RADASNCHC and RADASNRICH (see <A HREF="#vdwr">VDWR</A>).
The data statements in that program can
easily be changed by the user if a different set of standard values
is wanted.  Any atoms that cannot be identified by this subroutine
are assigned a default radius of 1.80 Angstroms. The radius of the
spherical probe may be assigned any value in the range 0.0 to 9.9 (see
<A HREF="#probe">PROBE</A>).  Adjustments to the source
program must be made to accommodate values outside of this range. A
water molecule is commonly assumed to have a radius of 1.40 Angstroms.
A flag system can be used to include or exclude atoms from the
accessibility calculation.
<p>
The output of the program is a file containing all of the input data
for each atom, the assigned Van der Waals radii, certain internal
flags indicating the atoms included in the calculation, the accessible
area, the contact area, and the fractional area (not yet implemented).
The accessible area is the area in square Angstroms units of the locus
of the center of the probe. The contact area is the area in square
angstroms on the Van der Waals surface of an atom that can be
contacted by a sphere of the given probe radius. The algorithm of
<a href="#reference1">Lee and Richards (1971)</A> is used to calculate
the accessible area.
<p>
[NOTE: The initial part of this program may be used to prepare an output
file to be used as input into the <A HREF="volume.html">VOLUME</a> program.]

<h2><A NAME="files"></A>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</h2>
<h3>Input files</h3>
<dl>
<dt>XYZIN1, XYZIN2
<dd>Input files of atom and coordinate data. These would normally
be in PDB format ('PDB'), although 'WAH', 'RAD' and 'CHA' are
also possible (see <A HREF="#format">FORMAT</A>). Normally
only XYZIN1 is used; use the <A HREF="#nfiles">NFILES keyword</A> to
specify two input files.
</dl>

<ul>
<li>PDB FORMATTED FILES - Header information is typed on the screen record 
by record until a line beginning with the word &quot;ATOM&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; or &quot;HETATM&quot; is found.
When the program assigns Van der Waals radii to the atoms an 
intermediate file is first created, containing only those lines
that have the &quot;ATOM&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; or &quot;HETATM&quot; keyword in the first six columns.
The program then reads the intermediate file line
by line assigning Van der Waals radii according to atom name and 
residue type.

<li>WAH FORMATTED FILES - The format is the same as the standard output 
file from KONNERT - HENDRICKSON refinement. It is assumed that no 
header information or remarks are included in these files.

<li>RAD FORMATTED FILES - These files are the standard output files of 
this program. It is generally recommended that when you work on a given
molecular structure that the accessibility calculation first be 
performed on the entire structure. This way you will have an output 
file that can be used as a reference file when different subsets are
calculated. You can also use this standard output file as the input 
file for future accessibility calculations on any SUBSET specified by
the flags. Since the Van der Waals radii have already been assigned and
are included in the file time can be save by skipping over the radius
assignment section. Also no intermediate file is needed as in the case
of PDB files. The time expended creating and reading from this
file is then eliminated. It is also useful as a reference when subsets
are calculated. You can then compare subset accessibility to the 
reference (entire molecule) accessibility. A further advantage is that
if you want to assign special values to atoms or define a subset that
can not be created easily within the program you can edit this 
reference file. An example might be that you want to change the Van der
Waals radii of a few individual atoms of a given atom name and residue 
type while leaving all the rest at the value assigned in the program.
This would have to be done by editing or creating a file of the &quot;RAD&quot;
format with all the particular values you desire. When this file in 
&quot;RAD&quot; FORMAT is read the Van der Waals radius indicated for each atom 
is accepted without regard to atom name or residue type.  This is 
particularly useful when only a few atoms have been assigned default 
radii because the radius assignment program wasn't prepared for the 
particular residue type or atom name.
</ul>

<h3>Output file</h3>
<dl>
<dt>XYZOUT
<dd>This is a formatted ASCII file 
(1X,I2,1X,I5,1X,I2,1X,I2,1X,2A4,1X,I3,3F8.3,2F5.2,2F6.1,1X,F4.2)
with the following columns:
<pre>
     KEY(I)     = flag for accessibility calculation.
     I          = integer counter
     NUMCHN(I)  = chain number if more than one peptide.
     NUMFIL(I)  = file number if more than one protein is listed.
     ATM(I)     = atom designation. Up to 4 characters (uses PDB convention).
     RES3(I)    = residue designation (three letter code).
     SEQNUM(I)  = sequence number of residue.
     X(I)       = X coordinate of atom.
     Y(I)       = Y coordinate of atom.
     Z(I)       = Z coordinate of atom.
     RVDW(I)    = Van der Waals radius of atom.
     RCOV(I)    = covalent radius of atom.
     AAREA      = accessible area of atom.
     CAREA      = contact area of atom.
     FRCACC     = fractional accessibility of atom (not yet implemented).
</pre>
This is a 'RAD' format file that can be used as input to this program.
It can also be used as input to the <A HREF="volume.html">VOLUME</a> program.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
The order of the keywords is important. It is advisable to read the whole
of this document first.

<P><i>Except within the first set, keywords must be entered in the
order described in this section. The first set of keywords is:</i>

<h3><A NAME="nfiles"></A>NFILES &lt;nfiles&gt;</h3>
Number of input files (default=1, maximum=2).

<h3><A NAME="format"></A>FORMAT &lt;file&gt; &lt;format&gt;</h3>
Specify format of input file number &lt;file&gt;. Possible values
of &lt;format&gt; are PDB, WAH, CHA or RAD. The default is for all
input files to have the Brookhaven PDB format, &lt;format&gt; = PDB.

<h3><A NAME="probe"></A>PROBE &lt;probe&gt;</h3>
&lt;probe&gt; between 0.0 and 9.9 (default 1.40).
The PROBE RADIUS is the radius of the sphere for which the
Van der Waals surface of each atom flagged  0 will be tested. It is
ordinarily assumed that you will be testing for accessibility to water.
We use a standard radius of 1.40 Angstroms for water so this is the 
default value. If you want to change the probe radius because you are
testing accessibility to something other than water or have a different
value for water this is where to make the change.

<h3><A NAME="zstep"></A>ZSTEP &lt;zstep&gt;</h3>
&lt;zstep&gt; between 0.1 and 1.0 (default 0.25).
The ZSTEP value will determine the accuracy of the accessibility
calculation. The program finds a given atom for which the accessibility is to
be calculated. Then it finds all the neighboring atoms (rejecting or
including according to <A HREF="#flag">FLAG value</A>), and sequentially slices through
the effective spheres of the set of atoms along the z axis. The circle 
of intersection of the atom for which the accessibility is being calculated is
analyzed to see what arc length of this circle is overlapped by the
intersecting circles of neighboring atoms. The arc distance that 
remains is then considered to be accessible to the <A HREF="#probe">PROBE</A>. The total 
accessibility is calculated by simply summing the arc
distances for all the slices through the particular atom of interest
and multiplying by the distance between the slices. This distance is
designated by the variable ZSTEP. The smaller the ZSTEP the more slices
and the greater the accuracy (also the more computer time). Since
the smallest Van der Waals radii are of the order of 1.10 Angstroms
and the probe will usually be 1.40 Angstroms the diameter of the 
smallest effective sphere = 2.0 x (1.40 + 1.10) = 5.0 Angstroms.
With a ZSTEP of 0.25 this would give 20 slices through the sphere.
This is acceptable for most of the conditions for which this program 
will be utilized. We recommend that the ZSTEP value be no less than 
0.10 and no greater than 0.50 for the reasons of program time and 
diminished accuracy respectively.

<h3><A NAME="vdwr"></A>VDWR CHC | RICH</h3>
Sets USECHC or USERIC (default USECHC = .TRUE. and USERIC = .FALSE.). <br>
Assign van der Waals radii to atoms based on atom name
and residue name. iflag(i,4) is set to negative if atom
is not found or residue is not found. If the residue
type is not found and the atom is a main chain atom:
&quot;C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;, &quot;N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;, &quot;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;,
&quot;CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;, the radius will be assigned
to either the original code  values (RICH) or 
the Cyrus values (CHC) (see <A HREF="#reference2">reference [2]</A>).

<h3><A NAME="skip"></A>SKIP</h3>
Toggles DOCALC off (default DOCALC = .TRUE.).
The output file will have the same format either way but one contains area
data and the other only dummy entries in those columns. If areas are
not needed, then that calculation can be avoided. Unlike the area
output file, which lists information for only those atoms for which the area
was calculated, the output file when DOCALC = .FALSE. is entered contains 
all the atoms read from the input file(s). The flags indicating <A HREF="#subset_omit">OMIT</A>, <A HREF="#subset_include">INCLUDE</A>
or <A HREF="#subset_calculate">CALCULATE</A> remain intact if you want to specify subsets of atoms for
the VOLUME calculation.

<p>
<i>This first set of keywords should be terminated with one of the following
three keywords:</i>

<h3><A NAME="run"></A>RUN</h3>
Do a calculation. The program reads the input
file(s), stores all the data into arrays and assigns the Van der Waals
radii. The number of atoms that have been read into the arrays will be
printed. If any atoms have not been found in the radius assignment
subroutine, the data associated with that atom will be displayed with
an annotation as to whether the RESIDUE NAME or ATOM NAME was not
found. If you are concerned because atoms have been assigned default
radii you should determine why the atom names or the residue names
were not found and try to correct the problem. This may mean editing
the subroutine responsible for assigning radii to include a new
RESIDUE TYPE or ATOM NAME. It may also mean that the format of your
input file was not aligned with the expected format. 

<h3><A NAME="rerun"></A>RERUN</h3>
It is assumed that the input files have been read on a previous
run, and van der Waals radii assigned. A new calculation on this
data is started.

<h3><A NAME="stop"></A>STOP</h3>
Stop and finish.
    
<p>
<A NAME="flag"></A><i>If everything is satisfactory, then the program moves to a second 
set of keywords.</i><BR> To allow flexibility and to reduce and eliminate unnecessary
repetition of calculations a flag system is utilized. Every atom is
assigned an integer FLAG value of -1, 0, or 1 with the following
meanings:
<dl>
<dt>-1 <dd>the atom is completely ignored during the accessibility
calculation. This would be the same as omitting the particular atom
from the input coordinate file.

<dt>0 <dd>the area is to be calculated for this atom. The surrounding
consists of all other atoms flagged either &quot;0&quot; or &quot;+1&quot;.

<dt>1 <dd>the atom is considered part of the protein environment but no
area calculations will be performed on this atom.
</dl>

The program will loop through the atoms until an atom has a flag
value 0. The program then finds all those atoms with a value of 0 or 1 that
fall within the 'touching' distance of the atom for which the calculation is
being performed. This distance will vary with the Van der Waals radii
and probe radius chosen.

<p>
<i>There are three keywords for assigning flags:</i>

<h3><A NAME="allatm"></A>ALLATM</h3>
Calculate the accessible surface of all atoms read into
the data arrays.

<h3><A NAME="preset"></A>PRESET</h3>
Only available if the input file(s) were of 'RAD' format.
This will take the flag values from the first column of this 
file and create the indicated subsets based on the standard 
flag values.

<h3><A NAME="subset"></A>SUBSET</h3>
Define a subset of atoms. If you have an interest in a particular
group of atoms, they can be specified rather than producing lengthy
output files and taking up unnecessary program run time. 
FLAGS can be used for finding changes in the accessibility of the
protein upon the removal of substrate(s) or upon deletion of a section
of the protein. They may also be used if you only have an interest in
the accessibility of certain RESIDUE types or ATOM types and do not
wish to waste time doing the calculation for all atoms in the
coordinate list. This option is designed to handle a few of the most
logical flag assignments. If you have something that cannot be handled
by the SUBSET flag setting subroutine, you can create your own
file and set the flags as you wish. The file should then be in the 'RAD' 
format and you should use the <A HREF="#preset">PRESET</A> keyword.

<p>
<i>If you choose the SUBSET option, then the following keywords can be used.</i><BR>
First define the flag value to be assigned with one of:

<p><A NAME="subset_omit"></A><b>OMIT</b> Assign flag of -1
<p><A NAME="subset_include"></A><b>INCL</b> Assign flag of  1
<p><A NAME="subset_calculate"></A><b>CALC</b> Assign flag of  0
<p><A NAME="subset_done"></A><b>DONE</b> No more flag assignments, proceed to next step in program.

<p>
<i>If one of the first three options is entered you can choose one
of six different ways to specify what atoms are to be assigned 
that particular flag:</i>

<p><A NAME="subset_file"></A><b>FILE</b>
Assign flag if atom came from one of two input files.
This is not available if only one input file was read.

<p><A NAME="subset_chain"></A><b>CHAI(N)</b>
Assign flag to an atom if it has the chain number 
specified. Many times a molecule will consist of two 
separate chains that are identified in the coordinate list.
Two monomers in an asymmetric unit or two subunits in a
dimer are usually identified separately.

<p><A NAME="subset_zone"></A><b>ZONE</b>
Assign flag based on a range of the sequence number. 
Any atom that has a sequence number greater than or 
equal to the starting value entered or less than or equal to
the ending value specified will be assigned the designated
flag. Repeat this operation for as many sequence
pairs as required. Entering the same number twice will 
result in the flag assignment to the single residue 
specified.

<p><A NAME="subset_residue"></A><b>RESI(DUE)</b>
Assign flag to an atom if the residue name is the same 
as the one specified. For instance in a protein you may only
be interested in calculating the accessibility of histidine
residues. If you enter the standard three letter notation 
&quot;HIS&quot; all histidines will be assigned the flag value.

<p><A NAME="subset_atom"></A><b>ATOM</b>
Assign flag to an atom if the atom name is the same as the
one specified. This is the same as the &quot;RESI&quot;
option, except that atom types are identified.

<p><A NAME="subset_serial"></A><b>SERI(AL)</b>
Assign flag based on a range of serial numbers of atoms
in the coordinate list. An atom of serial number equal to
or greater than the starting value entered or less than or
equal to the ending value entered will be assigned the
designated flag. Repeat through as many serial number pairs
as required. Entering the same number twice will result in
the flag assignment to the single atom specified.

<p>
If you have more than one input file you will be asked for the
file number for which flags are to be set.

<p>
The ORDER OF OPERATION in setting FLAGS is very important. Any
operation that is performed will overwrite the previous flag value
assigned to an atom. For example if a zone from 1 to 20 is assigned a
FLAG of -1 by using the &quot;OMIT&quot; flag and the &quot;ZONE&quot; operation, and then
the &quot;CALC&quot; flag is set to a ZONE from 5 to 10.  The end result would
be that the ZONE from 1 to 4 is OMITTED, the ZONE from 5 to 10 is
CALCULATED and the ZONE from 11 to 20 is OMITTED.  If &quot;CALC&quot; was first
called for the ZONE from 5 to 10 and the &quot;OMIT&quot; was called for ZONE 1
to 10 all the atoms associated with residues 1 to 10 would be OMITTED.

<p>
<i>Having set the flags, one of the following two keywords
should be entered:</i>

<h3><A NAME="reset"></A>RESET</h3>
Reset the flags with one of the above three keywords (for interactive use).

<h3><A NAME="next"></A>NEXT</h3>
Do calculation, and then return to the first set of keywords.
