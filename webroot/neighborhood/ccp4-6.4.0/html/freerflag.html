<H1>FREERFLAG (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2>NAME</H2>
<B>freerflag </B>
- tags each reflection in an MTZ file with a flag for cross-validation 

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P><B>freerflag</B> <B>HKLIN</B> <I>foo.mtz</I> <B>HKLOUT</B> <I>foo_out.mtz</I>
<BR>
[<a href="#keywords">Keyworded input</a>] </P>

<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P> This program is part of the <b>uniqueify</b> script (see documentation
for <a href="unique.html">UNIQUE</a>) and is used to tag each reflection with a
flag. It is strongly recommended that the reflection list for tagging is
generated by UNIQUE before FREERFLAG is run; <b>uniqueify</b> does both
these steps automatically.  The resulting reflection file will contain all
possible (h k l) for the structure spacegroup and for the defined
resolution. This file will be used for refinement and the tagged
reflections used for the calculation of `Free R factors' (<A HREF="#reference1">reference [1]</A>).  </P>

<P> This master list of FreeR assignments can then be transferred to any
new data sets, or to isomorphous data sets such as substrate complexes. 
This is important if you plan to start refinement against new data using
the previously refined model (as we all do!), or if you are combining
different methods of refinement. In these cases it is essential to tag the
SAME reflections. </P>

<P> This can be done by generating an mtz file with FreeR flags (the
<b>uniqueify</b> script is recommended), then using the program
MTZ2VARIOUS to convert it to any other (non-CCP4) format with the
appropriate flag. These formats use different conventions to indicate the
free and working sets: </P>

<P>
<table noborder>
<tr>
 <th valign=top>Program:
 <th align=left>Convention for free and working set flags:
<tr>
 <td valign=top>CCP4
 <td> assigns the flag FreeR_flag to be 0 for the free set and 1,...n-1
      for the working set.
<tr>
 <td valign=top>XPLOR
 <td> assigns the flag TEST to be 1 for the free set and 0 for the working
      set.
<tr>
 <td valign=top>CNS
 <td> assigns the flag TEST to be 1 for the free set and 0,2,...n-1 for the
      working set.
<tr>
 <td valign=top>SHELX
 <td> assigns a flag with -1 for the free set and 1 for the working set.
<tr>
 <td valign=top>TNT
 <td> assigns a flag with 0 to indicate the free set.
</table>
</P>

<P> Conversion from other (non-CCP4) formats requires the use of <A HREF="f2mtz.html">F2MTZ</A> to
convert the original file to an mtz file, which can then be extended to
fit the CCP4 convention. See examples for XPLOR CNS SHELX or TNT input.
The program FREERFLAG recognises the different conventions and
automatically transforms the flags into the ccp4 convention (see table
above). </P>

<H3><A NAME="files"></A>Input:</H3>

<DL>
<DT>HKLIN </DT>

<DD>This must contain: H K L plus some amplitude information. </DD>
</DL>

<H3>Output:</H3>

<DL>
<DT>HKLOUT </DT>

<DD>This will contain the same items as HKLIN plus the FreeR_flag appended
to each reflection. The column is given the LABEL `FreeR_flag', and the
CTYPE `I'. </DD>
</DL>

<P>By default the FreeR_flag for each reflection is 0, 1, 2 etc., randomly
and uniformly distributed reflexion-by-reflexion so that each value occurs
(on average) in a fraction of the data specified by the <a
href="#freerfrac">FREERFRAC</a> keyword. Under the CCP4 convention, the
free set is assigned a FreeR_flag = 0, and the working set is assigned a
flag between 1 and (n-1) where n = 1/fraction. </P>

<P>(Note that it is no longer possible to generate flags under the old system
where the FREE percentage have the flag 0,
and the rest of the data is flagged 1, and the OLDFREE keyword which used to
allow this is now obsolete.) </P>

<P>This means that it is possible to select
different blocks of reflections for exclusion, using a preset `exclusion
flag'. The selected value should be held constant throughout a complete
refinement run. For density modification and other procedures which need
full `cross validation' (<A HREF="#reference2">reference [2]</A>) it may be useful to be able to vary the FREE
set. WARNING - do NOT change the selected set casually! </P>

<P>If during any calculation (<EM>e.g.</EM> refinement, map calculation or agreement
analysis) the program label assignment `FREE=FreeR_flag' is made, reflections
which are flagged with the chosen value (default 0) are excluded from the
calculation. For instance, during refinement this means that the agreement
between their FP and the Fc is independent of the refinement procedure.
The Free R factor calculated for these reflections is a useful indicator
of the quality of the refinement, especially when there is a shortage of
observations and the structure is underdetermined. </P>

<H3>Treatment of systematic absences</H3>

<P>Systematically absent reflections (if present) are treated like other
reflections, and are also assigned a freeR flag. This is different to the
behaviour of previous versions of the program, where systematic absences
were flagged as "missing" by the FreeR_flag.

<H2><A NAME="keywords"></A>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>

<P>All the possible keywords are optional but if you wish to retain the
existing freeR flags then COMPLETE must be given. </P>

Keywords are: </P>

<a href="#freerfrac">FREERFRAC</a>, <a href="#seed">SEED</a>,
<a href="#complete">COMPLETE</a>, <a href="#end">END</a>

<P>The OLDFREE keyword is now obsolete and has no function. </P>

<H3><A NAME="freerfrac"></A>FREERFRAC &lt;fraction&gt;</H3>

<P>A &lt;fraction&gt; of all reflections in the file is flagged with a
given value (`indicator') in the FreeR_flag column. The indicators will
range from 0 to int(1.0/&lt;fraction&gt;)-1. &lt;fraction&gt; defaults
to 0.05 and therefore the indicators will range from 0 to 19. </P>

<H3><A NAME="seed"></A>SEED </H3>

<P>By default, for a given job on a given machine, the random number
generator produces the same list of "random" free-R flags each time
the job is run. Since you would generally only produce one list of
free-R flags for each project, this is not usually a problem. However,
if you specify the keyword SEED, then the random number generator is
seeded with the current time, and will produce a different list of
free-R flags each time the job is run. </P>

<H3><A NAME="complete"></A>COMPLETE FREE=&lt;column&gt;</H3>

<P>This option will complete an existing list of FREE flags when extending
the indices. If a FREE value is present in the file in &lt;column&gt; it
is carried through for output; if the FREE &lt;column&gt; isn't present
for a given reflection a value is given a value using the standard random
number generation. </P>

<P>The other keywords are ignored when COMPLETE is specified. The fraction
of data per bin is taken from the highest value of the freeR flag. If the
file has an old style freeR (<EM>i.e.</EM> 0 or 1) then the output MTZ has the same
format. The fraction of data flagged as free would then be calculated from
the existing reflections. This fraction maybe not be exactly the same as
the one you used originally because of statistical variations. See the
<A HREF="#examples">example</A>. </P>
