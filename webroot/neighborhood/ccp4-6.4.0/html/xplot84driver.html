<H1> xplot84driver (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>xplot84driver </b>
-  X-windows tool, a viewer for Plot84 meta files.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>xplot84driver</b>
<i>plot84_meta_file</i>
<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
xplot84driver belongs to the XCCPJiffy class of simple X11 graphic based
programs.
xplot84driver reads a Plot84 Metafile, recognises
pictures and interprets them.
<P> 
xplot84driver uses an X-Windows device and has an option to create
a PostScript file.
<P> 
Running the program xplot84driver creates a Header window with boxes
showing:
<dl>
<dt> Quit<dd>
to exit the program
<dt> (unnamed)<dd>
box containing current Plot84 meta file name
<dt> List of Pictures <dd>
A list of the pictures stored within the Plot84
metafile.  Select the picture to view with the Left Mouse Button.  This
generates the view window and QUIT in that window closes the window.
PLOT creates a PostScript version.  (If you want a file then go to
the CONTROL panel first.)
<dt> Control Panel<dd>
Clicking the Left Mouse button here allows one to toggle between
Portrait and Landscape for the output Postscript file conversion and
the option to specify a Output File for the Postscript file. The Print
command is controlled by the XCCPJiffy*psPlotCommand resource.  The
Quit button exits the control panel.

<H2> NOTE ON COLOURS AND LINE STYLES - For Users and Programmers</H2>
Where a program allows a user to specify colours in numbers
(for example PLUTO), then the user should be aware of the mapping
of colour numbers to real colours and to line properties of a
black/white PostScript Laser printer. These are controlled via
the entries in the X-resource database.
<P> 
xplot84driver works in colour/linewidth graphic mode, i.e. maps
colour numbers given by plot84 file contents to real colours for
X graphics and Postscript line attributes. Currently 10 colours
are available.
<P> 
X colours, Postscript line attributes and width are controlled
via the entries in X-resource database (see X manual). It
is recommended to load X-resources into the X-server 
database (xrdb).  Once the database is loaded, one can optimise 
it using xrdb to load/merge a personalised set of X-Application 
Resources.
<P> 
X mapping is controlled by:
<pre>
XCCPJiffy.plot84Picture*draw2d.background:      white
XCCPJiffy.plot84Picture*draw2d.color1:          black
   .
   .
   .
XCCPJiffy.plot84Picture*draw2d.col or10:         indigo
Line width is interpreted directly.
</pre>
<P> 
Postscript mapping is controlled by:
<pre>
XCCPJiffy*psColor1:     1 setlinejoin [] 0 setdash
   .
   .
   .
XCCPJiffy*psColor10:    1 setlinejoin [8 1] 0 setdash
Line width is calculated as:
   value from plot84matefile * XCCPJiffy*psBasicLineWidth resource
</pre>
To check your current setting use for instance
<br>
   xrdb -query | grep XCCPJiffy | more
