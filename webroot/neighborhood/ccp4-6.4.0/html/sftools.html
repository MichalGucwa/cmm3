<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>sftools </b>
- Reflection data file utility program including some density map handling
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>sftools </b>
<br>
 [<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>]

<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>
<P>The SFTOOLS program is a toolbox of commands to analyze, manipulate, and
convert structure factor files. The program has been written with an
interactive user in mind and will provide on-line help, suggestions and
warnings as appropriate. A list of the currently implemented commands
plus descriptions of their use is given in the <A HREF="#reference">command reference section</A>
at the end of this document. The list of commands can always be obtained
by just pressing the return key when the program asks for a command. To
get the command descriptions, the user should type the name of a command
followed by the keyword HELP.</P>

<P>SFTOOLS is very flexible which gives the user great power to
accomplish many tasks. At the same time the program contains many
checks to protect you, as far as possible, from using the flexibility
inappropriately. This design goal makes it more
difficult to write a script to run the program as a batch job. If you
have to make a script then you may find it easier to run the program once
interactively and paste the commands into the script file as you go.
At this moment it is not possible to obtain a log file of your
interactive session, you will have to run the program from a script if
you really need one. Creating a log file will be implemented in the
next release of the program.</P>

<P>SFTOOLS has also some density map functionality. It can read/write, CCP4,
BIOMOL and DSN6 maps, and it can create maps from structure factors and vice
versa. A very useful combination is to create your map (<A HREF="#fft">FFT</A>), cut out a block
of density surrounding your protein (<A HREF="#maplimit">MAPLIMIT</A>), and write it out as a DSN6
file (<A HREF="#mapout">MAPOUT</A>), all in one interactive session.</P>

<P>A lot of the functionality of SFTOOLS is also covered by a large number
of other CCP4 programs. The main advantage of using SFTOOLS is that you
can do all your manipulations and analyses in one session without having
to run multiple programs and create script files and output files with
intermediate results. In addition, many users like the interactive and
user friendly nature of the program.</P>

<H2><A NAME="general"></A>General program description</H2>
SFTOOLS consists of a central data base and a set of subroutines that
interact with it. The data base consists of 3 large arrays plus several
other variables to store the header information. When reading file
formats with less information than the MTZ format the user is asked
to supply the missing information.<BR>
Here are the four most important data base components:

<DL>
 <DT>IHKL</DT>
  <DD>This is a 1-dimensional array that stores the reflection indices.
   Each index triplet is packed into a 4-byte integer which is used as
   a unique reflection identifier. Each index ideally occurs only once
   and obeys the CCP4 asymmetric unit definitions. Only multi-record
   MTZ files can have multiple reflections with the same indices. Unlike
   other CCP4 programs, indices are not considered as data base columns
   and their content can only be changed with the <A HREF="#reindex">REINDEX</A> command.<BR>
   The size of the IHKL array is determined by parameter MAXREF in the
   sftools.inc file.</DD>

 <DT>REF</DT>
  <DD>The REF array contains all the actual data columns. In the program
   it is a 1-dimensional array, but it appears as a 2-dimensional array
   to the user, <EM>e.g.</EM> rows=reflections and columns=Fobs, Sigma, Phase etc...
   The user can identify a specific column by typing &quot;COLUMN column_id&quot;.
   column_id is either the column label or the column number. The column
   label is case insensitive but may need to be quoted if it contains
   unusual characters. Labels will fail if columns with identical
   labels exist (bad practice). Column numbers should always work. Note
   that the indices do not count as columns so if your file contains
   H K L Fobs Sigma, then Fobs is column 1.<BR>
   SFTOOLS can also read, write, and create density maps. Maps are stored
   at the end of the REF array whereas reflections are stored at the
   beginning.<BR>
   The size of the REF array is determined by parameter MAXDAT in the
   sftools.inc file. The number of columns times the number of reflections
   in your file should be less then MAXDAT. At the same time the number
   of reflections should be less then MAXREF and the number of columns
   less then MAXCOL.</DD>

 <DT>ACTIVE</DT>
  <DD>The ACTIVE column is a boolean flag that indicates which reflections
   should be used and which should be ignored. Initially all reflections
   are &quot;active&quot; but this can be changed with the <A HREF="#select">SELECT</A> keyword. For
   instance to restrict all following commands to 10 - 3 Angstrom resolution
   you would type &quot;SELECT resol &gt; 3 &lt; 10&quot;. You can use SELECT ALL to make
   all reflections active again.<BR>
   The size of the ACTIVE array is determined by parameter MAXREF in the
   sftools.inc file.</DD>

 <DT>TYPE</DT>
  <DD>The TYPE array stores the column type of each column as a 1 character
   code. The codes follow the <A HREF="#coltyp">MTZ definition for column types</A>.
   SFTOOLS actively uses the column types to
   prevent you from comparing apples and oranges, keeping phase information
   consistent <EM>etc</EM>.</DD>
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="filling"></A>Filling the data base</H3>

<P>After starting the program you will want to load data into the data base. In
most cases this means reading a structure factor file. To do this use the
<A HREF="#read_examples">READ</A> command. If the data base was empty then
SFTOOLS will read both the header and the diffraction data. If a non-MTZ file
is read the program will prompt for missing header information. If you read in
a second structure factor file (or you prepared the header information with
the <A HREF="#set">SET ALL</A> command or by reading a density map) then
SFTOOLS will compare the header information on the second file with what is
in the data base. It will report inconsistencies, but in all cases the
information in the data base will be kept. It is useful to have an empty
MTZ with header information for your project but no data. When reading a
non-MTZ file then you first read the empty MTZ to get the header information.
This way you avoid to have to enter the header information and the possible
typos that that might introduce.</P>

<P>When a second (or more) structure factor file is read, the program will
add new columns to the data base to store the data from the new file.
Data for reflections that are already present in the data base will be
appended to that reflection. Data for reflections that are not yet present
in the data base will be stored in newly created reflections. In this case
MNFs are inserted in the old columns (see the 0 0 1 reflection below).
When a reflection was present in the data base but not in the new structure
factor file, then the columns for the new structure factor file are set to
MNF (see the 0 0 3 reflection below). An example is given below.</P>

<PRE>
Assume that you have the following two structure factor files

file1.mtz              file2.mtz

0 0 2 12.4  3.2        0 0 1 82.7 10.1
0 0 3 68.7 12.1        0 0 2 13.8  3.8
0 1 3  3.2 17.0        0 1 3  4.8 17.2
0 1 5 34.0  5.8        0 1 5 37.1  4.8

in SFTOOLS you type:

read file1.mtz
read file2.mtz

The data base will then contain

0 0 1  MNF  MNF 82.7 10.1
0 0 2 12.4  3.2 13.8  3.8
0 0 3 68.7 12.1  MNF  MNF
0 1 3  3.2 17.0  4.8 17.2
0 1 5 34.0  5.8 37.1  4.8
</PRE>

<P>SFTOOLS will merge, sort and check your data. For further consistency
checks you can give the <A HREF="#checkhkl">CHECKHKL</A> command after
reading a file. This also gives you a few seconds to think about your
next action while CHECKHKL is working.</P>

<H3><A NAME="data_representation"></A>Data representation</H3>

<P>All data, including integers, are stored as real numbers. Phase information
is stored in radians but they will appear in degrees to the user (as long
as the column type is set to &quot;P&quot;). RFREE flags follow the CCP4 definition
in which the data is divided into N RFREE sets with flags running from 0 to
N-1. When reading/writing non-MTZ files, the RFREE flag definitions will
be converted to/from the CCP4 definition, respectively. The RFREE set with a
flag of 0 is considered to be the actual RFREE set.</P>

<P>When reflections have missing data in one or more of their columns, then
this is indicated by a Missing Number Flag (MNF). SFTOOLS uses a value of
-1.0E+10 to indicate missing data. When reading/writing MTZ files, the
SFTOOLS MNF is converted from/to the CCP4 MNF definition respectively. It
is crucial that proper MNFs are present. If you have missing data without
MNFs, then you can introduce MNFs easily with the <A HREF="#absent">ABSENT</A>
command.</P>

<H3><A NAME="asu_definition"></A>Asymmetric unit definition</H3>

<P>Several commands need to know how the asymmetric unit is defined. The
default is to use the CCP4 definition and it is highly recommended to
stick with it (in the next release SFTOOLS will enforce adherence to
the CCP4 definition). If you use a different definition then you can
either convert to the CCP4 definition with the <A HREF="#reduce">REDUCE</A>
command or you have to specify the definition each time you use a command
that is definition dependent (this is very error prone, that is why it will
be changed in the next release).</P>

<H3><A NAME="input_parsing"></A>Input parsing</H3>

<P>The program input is analyzed by a parser that divides the input into
words. Words may be delimited by one or more spaces or any of the following
characters <B>(&nbsp;)&nbsp;,&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;=&nbsp;[&nbsp;]</B>. If you need to generate words including any of
these characters or spaces (<EM>e.g.</EM> in a file name or column label) then the
word(s) must be enclosed in double quotes.<BR>
Real numbers can be read in any format acceptable to FORTRAN, examples are:
1234 1234.5 1.2345E+3. Integers should be made up exclusively by digits 0
to 9 except for the first character which may be a minus sign. Character
input is case insensitive except for file names.</P>

<P>The often used keyword COLUMN may be abbreviated to COL. Likewise,
RESOLUTION may be replaced by RESOL. A more consistent method for
abbreviating keywords will be implemented later.</P>

<H3><A NAME="command_arguments"></A>Command arguments</H3>

<P>It is advised for most commands to give the command name and its arguments
on a single line. If you leave out the arguments 3 things
can happen:<BR>
<LI>The subroutine uses default values</LI>
<LI>The program requests the missing information interactively</LI>
<LI>The program complains and suggests that you read the help information</LI></P>

<H3><A NAME="ccp4_compatibility"></A>CCP4 compatibility</H3>

<P>SFTOOLS is meant to adhere to the MTZ standard in all respects. However,
the author does not use CCP4 extensively so there may still be some minor
differences (<A HREF="mailto:ccp4@dl.ac.uk">please report them</A>). Specific treatment of multi-record
MTZ files is limited at this point. Most options will probably work fine
with them but this has not been tested.<BR>
CCP4 supports maps of several types. SFTOOLS can read and write standard
CCP4 electron density maps. The use of other map types has not been tested.</P>

<P>The user interface of SFTOOLS was developed independently of CCP4
practices and CCP4 parsing routines. Definitions of LABIN, LABOUT, HKLIN,
HKLOUT and other common features of the CCP4 user interface are not
supported. However, the user interface was designed for interactive
use and should be easy to get used to. SFTOOLS can also prepare
tabular data. Commands that prepare tables also allow the user some
control over the table creation. In the next release of SFTOOLS this
table control will be handled by a separate command. In the future
tables may also support the use of <A HREF="xloggraph.html">XLOGGRAPH</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="read_examples"></A>Reading structure factor files</H3>

<P>To read a structure factor file, SFTOOLS needs to know the name of the file,
the format of the file, and the columns to be read. The name has to be
supplied by the user. By default SFTOOLS reads all columns and it stores
them in file order. However, the user can use the <A HREF="#read_column">COLUMN</A> keyword to
control the columns to be read and their order in the data base. The file
format will in most cases be determined from the file name extension,
see below. If the format and extension do not match then the user can
explicitly specify the format by a <A HREF="#read_format">FORMAT</A> keyword.

</TABLE>

In addition to reflection information, SFTOOLS also needs some header
information. The MTZ format has the most complete header information
and SFTOOLS needs most of it. If you read a non-MTZ file then SFTOOLS
will prompt you for the missing header information. It is worthwhile
to make an MTZ file for your project with just the header information
in it. If you have to read a non-MTZ file then just first read in the
MTZ with the header info and there will be no more questions asked.</P>

<P>SFTOOLS can read any generic ASCII file if:<BR>
<LI>There are no header lines</LI>
<LI>All reflections have the same format and number of columns</LI>
<LI>The indices H, K, and L are in columns 1, 2, and 3, respectively</LI></P>

<P>Most ASCII files will be readable as is, however, if yours is not
well-behaved then you can fix it as follows.
<OL>
<LI>Use an editor or the Unix tail command to get rid of header lines:<BR>
<TT>tail +3 file_in &gt; file_out</TT><BR>
skips the first 2 lines.</LI>
<LI>Use the Unix awk command to force all reflections to have the same
format or to place the indices in the first three columns:<BR>
<TT>awk '{printf(&quot;%4d%4d%4d%8.1f%8.1f&quot;,$3,$4,$5,$1,$2)}' file_in &gt; file_out</TT><BR>
swaps the order of the columns {1,2,3,4,5 to 3,4,5,1,2} and forces each
line to have the same format.</LI>

and will prompt the user for missing information.<BR>
CCP4 and BIOMOL maps can be sectioned in any order, however, SFTOOLS
will internally always store the map in ABC order (sections along C
and rows along B). For CCP4 maps not all map types may be supported,
but the standard electron density maps should work.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> DSN6 files use only a single byte per grid point. It
may be better to recreate your map from the map coefficients or to
re-read the original MFF or CCP4 electron density file.</P>

<H3><A NAME="write_examples"></A>Writing structure factor files</H3>

<P>To write a structure factor file, SFTOOLS needs to know the name of the
file, the format of the file, and the columns to be written. The name
has to be supplied by the user. By default SFTOOLS writes all columns
in the same order as they are stored in the data base. However, the user
can use the <A HREF="#write_column">COLUMN</A> keyword to control the columns to write and their
order in the output file. The file format will in most cases be
determined from the file name extension, see the
<A HREF="#sf_extensions">extensions table</A>. In order to write a generic ASCII formatted file
you have to specify the FORTRAN format string. It is absolutely required
that the first 3 values are written as integers since these will be the
indices. <B>ALL</B> other values <B>MUST</B> be written as reals because
that is how they are stored in the program.</P>

<P>Some of the supported file formats are restricted in the number of
columns and/or types of data that they accept. The user should use the
<A HREF="#write_column">COL</A> keyword if needed to write the appropriate data. The requirements
are detailed in the <A HREF="#write">WRITE</A> description.

the user and in most cases the format can be determined from the file
name extension, see below. If the format and extension do not match
then the user can explicitly specify the format by a <A HREF="#mapout_format">FORMAT</A> keyword, see

<P>The current version of SFTOOLS always writes the complete density map.
To write a subsection of the map you should use the <A HREF="#maplimit">
MAPLIMIT</A> command. In the next release the MAPLIMIT functions will be
moved to the <A HREF="#mapout">MAPOUT</A> command in a more general way. By default, SFTOOLS
will write a map in ABC order (sections along C and rows along B). For
CCP4 and BIOMOL maps the user can specify a different order by adding

<H3><A NAME="absent_examples"></A>Creating missing number flags</H3>

<P>If you have missing data then it is crucial for SFTOOLS that they are
flagged by Missing Number Flags (MNFs). Old-style CCP4 programs relied
on a SIGMA column being zero to indicated missing data. SFTOOLS will
warn you when you read such an old-style file. Inserting proper MNFs
is easy with the <A HREF="#absent">ABSENT</A> command. The basic command structure is

<PRE>
ABSENT <B>COL col_ids</B> IF <B>SELECTION</B>
</PRE>

<B>SELECTION</B> can be any valid selection (see <A HREF="#select">SELECT</A>),
whereas <B>COL col_ids</B> is a list of column labels or
column numbers. MNFs are inserted in all listed columns for the
reflections that fit the selection criterium. It is a good idea to
give a <A HREF="#select_criterium_all">SELECT ALL</A> command prior to using the ABSENT command to make
sure that all reflections will be used.</P>

  OPTION: CALCulate  RESULT = expression
  ======================================

  Command to perform arithmetic on data columns.
  The expression is evaluated and stored in the
  column(s) indicated by result.

  The expression may contain operands and
  operators and should follow the Polish notation.
  This means that first the operands are given and
  then the operator. (<EM>e.g.</EM> 5+3 becomes 5 3 +). It
  is the users responsibility to assure that the
  correct number of operands are given for each
  operator (see list below). Operands may either be
  a value, a column_id or some kind of function
<A NAME="calc_value"></A> - VALUE : integer, real or complex value. Complex
           values consisting of an amplitude and
           phase must be enclosed in parentheses
           <EM>e.g.</EM> i=(1.0 90.0) or square brackets if
           they represent the real and imaginary
           parts. <EM>e.g.</EM> i=[0.0 1.0].

<A NAME="calc_column"></A> - COLUMN: A COLumn keyword followed by 1 or 2
           column_ids (numbers or labels). Give
           1 column_id if you wish to use the value
           in that column. Give 2 column_ids if the
           columns contain complex data. Enclose
           the keyword and the ids in parentheses
           if the columns contain an amplitude and
           a phase. Use square brackets if they
           contain the real and imaginary parts.
           If a column value is absent then the
           whole expression evaluates to absent.

<A NAME="calc_function"></A> FUNCTION  one of the following built-in functions

 - C     : This evaluates to 0 for centric and to
           1 for acentric reflections
 - M     : This evaluates to the reflection
           multiplicity (<EM>e.g.</EM> 2 on two-fold etc)
 - P     : This evaluates to the phase restriction
           for centric reflection or MNF for
           non-centrics
 - H     : Returns the H-index for this reflection
 - K     : Returns the K-index for this reflection
 - L     : Returns the L-index for this reflection
 - RAN_U : Return a random number from a uniform
<A NAME="calc_seed"></A>           distribution between 0 and 1. The set of
           random numbers depends on a seed value
           which is 1234 by default. To modify the
           seed value (and hence get a novel set of
           random numbers) you must issue a command
           CALC SEED number
           where number can be any positive integer
 - RAN_G : Return a random number from a Gaussian
           distribution with mean 0 and variance 1
           (see RAN_U for the SEED value)
 - RFREE(r)
           Randomly returns 0 and 1 values for use
           in RFREE for XPLOR. If 0 &lt; r &lt; 1 then r
           represents the fraction of data to use
           for the free R-factor. If r &gt; 1 then it
           represents the absolute number of
           reflections to use.
 - STOL  : This evaluates to sin(theta/lambda)
 - STOLSQ: This evaluates to sin(theta/lambda)**2

<A NAME="calc_result"></A>  RESULT : Indicates where to store the result of
           the expression. RESULT can be:
  TYPE COLumn c1, (COLumn c1 c2), [COLumn c1 c2]
  In the first case a result is stored in column c1
  The column type will be set to TYPE or to R if no
  type is specified.
  In the second case a complex result is stored in
  columns c1 and c2 as an amplitude and phase resp.
  The column types are set by the program. In the
  third case, the complex result is stored as the
  real and imaginary parts resp. again with the
  column types set automatically.
  The result columns are created if necessary

<A NAME="calc_operator"></A>  OPERATOR (REAL OPERANDS, COMPLEX OPERANDS)

      + (2,4) : Summation
      - (2,4) : Subtraction
      * (2,4) : Multiplication

    TAN (1,-) : Tangent
    DTR (1,-) : Convert from degrees to radians
    RTD (1,-) : Convert from radians to degrees
    ABS (1,2) : Absolute value. For complex values
                this is the complex vector length
     LN (1,-) : Natural logarithm
    EXP (1,-) : Exponent
    MIN (2,4) : Minimum of two values

  CALC COL sigma = COL fobs 10 /
    set sigma to fobs/10. The result column will
    keep column type Q
  CALC COL F/sigF = COL 1 COL 2 /
    add a column labeled F/sigF and store fobs
    over sigma in it. The result column will get
    column type R
  CALC COL stol = stol
    add a column labeled stol and store sin(theta)
    over lambda in it for each reflection

    add a column labeled centric that contains 0
    for acentrics and 1 for centrics
  CALC COL fcalc = COL fcalc ran_g 100 * +
    ran_g returns a random number from a Gaussian
    distribution. Multiply this by 100 to get a
    mean of 0 and variance of 100 (st. dev. of 10)
    and then add it to your fcalc
  CALC q COL newsigma = 2 COL sigma *
    add column with label newsigma twice the value
    found in column sigma. Set the type of the new
    column to Q!!!
  CALC J COL iobs = 0.001 COL fobs * COL fobs *
    add column with label iobs and type J iequal to 
    0.001*fobs*fobs.  ( intensity scaled by 0.001)
  CALC Q COL sigiobs = 0.002 COL sigma * COL fobs *
    add column with label sigiobs and type Q equal to

<A NAME="fourpt_columns"></A>  COLUMNS is the COL keyword followed by column
  specifications. The columns have to be specified
  in the order in which they occur in the formulae
  F1 and F2 represent amplitude columns. P1 and P2
  represent phase columns. The map coefficients are
  stored in 2 new columns with labels FMAP and PMAP

  reflections that are already in the data base
  (even if they are unselected).

<A NAME="map2sf_resol"></A>  RESOL r
  This keyword indicates that ALL legal reflections
  (except F000) to a resolution of &quot;r&quot; Angstrom
  will be stored. The default is to store only the
  reflections for which there is already an entry
  in the data base. If there are no reflections in
  the data base and RESOL is not specified, then
  all legal reflections to a resolution of 3 times
  the largest grid spacing are calculated

<A NAME="map2sf_f000"></A>  F000
  If given this indicates that F000 should also be
  kept (WARNING, many programs, potentially incl.
  SFTOOLS, do not like the infinite resolution of
  F000).

<A NAME="map2sf_col"></A>  COL id1 id2
  If id1 and id2 are text labels, then id1 and id2
  are given to the new amplitude and phase columns
  If id1 and id2 are numbers of existing columns
  then the new amplitude and phase columns will
  overwrite the id1 and id2 columns. If the COL
  keyword is not given then SFTOOLS will create 2
  columns with COLUMN_NNN labels where NNN is the
  column number

  Note: If your map is on absolute scale then the
  Fourier coefficients will be as well

  OPTION: MAPIN FILENAME [FORMAT]
  ===============================

  Command to read in an electron density file.

<A NAME="mapin_filename"></A>  FILENAME    is the name of the file. The program
    will try to deduce the file format from the
    extension. It will recognize .mff, .map, .dn6
<A NAME="mapin_format"></A>  FORMAT      can be one of the following:
    MFF, MAP, DN6
    This overrules the file name extension format

  File formats are:
  MFF   BIOMOL format
  MAP   CCP4 real*4 format
  DN6   FRODO / O map format

  NOTE: DN6 maps for hardware other then SGI may not
        be compatible with SFTOOLS. Please let <A HREF="mailto:bart.hazes@ualberta.ca">me</A>
        know about problems

  EXAMPLE:

  MAPIN file.mff
  MAPIN file.map
  MAPIN file.dn6
  MAPIN file.rho MFF

  Notes:
  The input map can be in any order. However it is
  stored internally in A-B-C order. There can only
  be one map in memory. An existing map has to be
  deleted before reading a new one (<A HREF="#delete_map">DELETE MAP</A>)

<H2><A NAME="maplimit"></A>MAPLIMIT</H2>
<PRE>

  NOTICE: Option MAPLIMIT will become obsolete in the next release and
          will no longer be supported. Try to avoid using it in scripts.
          In the next release the functionality of MAPLIMIT will be
          moved to the <A HREF="#mapout">MAPOUT</A> command. This allows a fully general and
          robust implementation.

  OPTION: MAPLIMIT TYPE value(s)
  ==============================

  Command to restrict a map to certain limits.
<A NAME="maplimit_type"></A>  The limits can be specified in various ways as
  indicated by the TYPE keyword which can be one
  of the following:

<A NAME="maplimit_type_pdb"></A>  PDB filename PLUS r
    This returns a block of density that surrounds
    the atoms in the PDB file leaving an extra
    "r" Angstrom on all sides. If "PLUS r" is not
    specified a default of 5 Angstrom is used

<A NAME="maplimit_type_grid"></A>  GRID a_l a_u b_l b_u c_l c_u
    This returns a block of density with lower and
    upper limits along a, b and c as given in grid
    coordinates

<A NAME="maplimit_type_fract"></A>  FRACT a_l a_u b_l b_u c_l c_u
    This returns a block of density with lower and
    upper limits along a, b and c as given in
    fractional coordinates

<A NAME="maplimit_type_ortho"></A>  ORTHO a_l a_u b_l b_u c_l c_u
    This returns a block of density with lower and
    upper limits along a, b and c as given in
    orthogonal (Angstrom) coordinates

  EXAMPLES:

  MAPLIMIT PDB protein.pdb PLUS 4
  MAPLIMIT FRACT 0 0.5 0 0.5 0 0.5
  MAPLIMIT GRID -5 34 0 60 12 49

  Notes:
  Every gridpoint in the new map must be present in
  the current map. It is allowed to go outside the
  unix cell, but none of the new axes can be larger
  than a full unit cell axis. <EM>E.g.</EM> if the a-axis
  runs from 0 to 99, you can ask for the subset
  -5 to 20, but not -5 to 99

  OPTION: MAPOUT FILENAME [FORMAT] [ORDER a b c]
  ==============================================

  Command to write a electron density file.

<A NAME="mapout_filename"></A>  -FILENAME is the name of the file. The program
   will try to deduce the file format from the
   extension. It will recognize .mff, .map, .dn6
<A NAME="mapout_format"></A>  FORMAT   can be one of the following:
   MFF, MAP, DN6
   This overrules the file name extension format
<A NAME="mapout_order"></A>  ORDER   By default the map is written with
          sections along C, rows along B and grid
          steps along A (ORDER A B C). By giving
          different permutations of A B C you can
          change the map layout.

  File formats are:
  MFF   BIOMOL format
  MAP   CCP4 real*4 format
  DN6   FRODO / O map format

  NOTE: I have only created DN6 maps for display on SGI
        If you use it on different hardware then please
        let <A HREF="mailto:bart.hazes@ualberta.ca">me</A> know if it works or not.

  EXAMPLE:

  MAPOUT file.mff

  OPTION: MERGE MODE
  ==================

  Command to merge reflections with identical
  indices. There are two modes:
<A NAME="merge_mode_safe"></A>  SAFE     Reflections are only merged if none of
           the columns has valid data entries in
           more than one reflection [default]
<A NAME="merge_mode_average"></A>  AVERAGE  Merging is done by taking the average
           of the reflections

  MERGE merges multiple reflections with identical
  HKL, it does not merge different columns!!!
  The AVERAGE option exists, but you should never
  need to use it. If you need it you probably have
  some kind of problem with your data

  EXAMPLES:

  MERGE SAFE
  MERGE AVERAGE   (if you know what you are doing)

  NOTICE: Option MODE will no longer be supported in the next release.
          If you want to add your own options please contact me.

  OPTION: OPTION1 ....
  ====================

  Option1 is a dummy option that provides a means
  for users to add their own option. To do so,
  insert your code in this subroutine and modify
  this help text. If you wish to give the option a
  more sensible name then you have to modify the
  calling sequence in the main routine, the name
  in routine lstopt and of course the name in the
  subroutine header and in the last write statement

  If you plan to do some major programming, then it
  might be wise to contact <A HREF="mailto:bart.hazes@ualberta.ca">me</A> first, since your
  option might already exist in my experimental
  version. In addition I could supply you with a
  makefile and some other goodies

  If your option is of general interest, then you
  are urged to return the source code to me so that
  it can be implemented in the official release

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="read"></A>READ</H2>
<PRE>
 OPTION: READ FILENAME [FORMAT] [COLUMN columns]
 ===============================================

 Command to read a structure factor file.

<A NAME="read_filename"></A> -FILENAME is the name of the file. The program
  will try to deduce the file format from the
  extension. It will recognize .mtz, .mdf, .snd,
  .xpl, .tnt, .31, .fin, .phs, .df, and .fmt
<A NAME="read_format"></A> FORMAT can be one of the following: MTZ, MDF,
  SND, XPL, TNT, 31, FIN, PHS, DF or FMT
  This overrules the file name extension format
<A NAME="read_column"></A> COLUMN Keyword to select specific columns
  Columns can be specified by numbers or labels
  (also mixed), and in any order. The order of
  columns in SFTOOLS will reflect the specified
  order and not the order on the MTZ. A column
  may even be listed more than once!
  If no columns are given, then the program will
  ask the user for each column  whether or not
  to include it. If no COLUMN keyword is given
  all columns are read
  THE COLUMN KEYWORD MUST BE THE LAST ARGUMENT !

 File formats are:
 MTZ   CCP4 format
 MDF   old BIOMOL format
 SND   BIOMOL ascii format
 XPL   XPLOR format
 TNT   TNT format
 31    PHASES short and long binary formats
 FIN   Xtalview fin-format
 PHS   Xtalview phs-format
 DF    Xtalview double fin-format
 FMT   File in arbitrary ASCII format

 NOTE: All formats except MTZ may need additional
 header information. The program will request this
 information interactively if necessary. All but
 the MTZ, MDF, SND and FMT formats have certain
 restrictions on the number, order, and type of
 columns. It is the users responsibility to use the
 COLUMN keyword to read the appropriate number and
 types of columns. SFTOOLS will check that you
 obey these restrictions.

 EXAMPLES:

 READ myfile.mtz
 (read all columns of myfile.mtz in mtz format)

 READ myfile.hkl MTZ COLUMN 3 1 2
 (read columns 1, 2 and 3 of myfile.hkl in mtz
 format. Column 3 will be column 1 in SFTOOLS)

 READ myfile.mtz COL
 (read myfile.mtz in mtz format and ask for each
  column whether or not it should be read)

 READ myfile.fmt
 (read the ASCII file myfile.fmt The program will
  figure out the format for you based on the first
  line(s) of the file. It will ignore character
  data amidst reflection data but you must edit
  out header lines (try the unix TAIL command).
  Also, all lines must have the same format as the
  first line(s). The program will ask you how many
  lines each reflection uses so that it can handle
  reflections that span more than one line. It
  also asks you how phase information is encoded
  Your file must contain the indices in the first
  three data columns (preceding character data is
  no problem though). If this is not the case then
  you can use the unix AWK command to fix it.
  The following awk command would correct a file
  which has the indices in columns 3, 4 and 5

  awk '{printf(&quot;%4d%4d%4d%8.1f%8.1f&quot;,$3,$4,$5,$1,$2)}' file_in &gt; file_out

  One last note: if your file contains missing
  data in some manner (<EM>e.g.</EM> Sigma=0) then you will
  have to use the <A HREF="#absent">ABSENT</A> command to insert proper
  missing number flags (MNFs) for these reflections

<H2><A NAME="reduce"></A>REDUCE</H2>
<PRE>
  OPTION: REDUCE [SILENT] [ASUNIT]
  ================================

  Command to reduce reflections to the asymmetric
  unit. Phases &amp; Hendrickson/Lattman coefficients
  (if present) will be updated

<A NAME="reduce_silent"></A>  SILENT  Keyword to suppress output
<A NAME="reduce_asunit"></A>  ASUNIT  Asymmetric unit definition which can be:
  CCP4    Use CCP4 definitions (default)
  BIOMOL  Use BIOMOL definitions
  TNT     Use TNT definitions
  MATRIX  Keyword followed by 9 integers i1-i9
          which define a packing matrix definition

  The asymmetric unit is defined as the set of
  reflections which maximize:
  (i1*h+i2*k+i3*l)*1024**2+(i4*h+i5*k+i6*l)*1024+
   i7*h+i8*k+i9*l

  Example: P4 hkl:h&gt;=0,l&gt;=0 0kl:k&gt;=0 h&gt;0:k&gt;0
  MATRIX  0 0 1  1 1 0  0 1 0
  0 0 1 selects the hemisphere L&gt;=0
  1 1 0 selects the quadrant H+K&gt;=0
  0 1 0 selects the 0kl instead of h0l

  EXAMPLE:
  REDUCE CCP4
  Reduces all indices to the asymmetric unit defined by CCP4

  OPTION: REINDEX [MATRIX]
  ========================

  Command to transform the indices.
<A NAME="reindex_matrix"></A>  MATRIX  Keyword followed by 9 numbers specifying
          the transformation matrix (row-wise). The
          program does not check the validity of
          the matrix and phases will not be changed
          The user also has to update the header
          manually if required

  After the transformation, the data are resorted
  and all cells transformed.

  EXAMPLE:
  REINDEX MATRIX 1 0 0  0 0 1  0 1 0
  Transforms H K L into H L K

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="rfree"></A>RFREE</H2>
<PRE>
  OPTION: RFREE nr_of_rfree [SHELL [width]]

  NOTE: this subroutine uses the CCP4 definition
  of RFREE data with 0=test set and 1=working set
  When you write out an XPLOR file then these flags
  are automatically converted to the reverse
  definition of XPLOR. A future version will also
  allow flags &gt; 1 for multi-set RFREE flags

  Create a column named RFREE with values set to 0
  for RFREE reflections and 1 for the others. The
  number of RFREE reflections is determined by the
  nr_of_rfree argument. By default RFREE
  reflections are selected at random.

<A NAME="rfree_shell"></A>  If the optional SHELL keyword is given then RFREE
  reflections will be taken in resolution shells
  The width of the resolution shells is 1/400th of
  the resolution range unless specified otherwise
  by the user. You may wish to try this if you have
  non-crystallographic symmetry. However, to get a
  reasonable number of shells they have to be
  thinner than I would like. In the future I may allow to
  actually input your NCS symmetry

  OPTION: SORT CRITERIUM DIRECTION
  ================================

  Command to sort the structure factor data base.

<A NAME="sort_criterium"></A>  CRITERIUM can be one of the following
  -[h k l] sort order may be specified as h k l
   or 1 2 3 or permutations thereof. The default
   is to sort on the current sort order as defined
   in the header info. The indices are always
   sorted in ascending order
  -RESOLution  Sort on resolution
  -COLumn      Sort on content of column id

<A NAME="sort_direction"></A>  DIRECTION can be either:
  -UP    Ascending sort order (this is the default)
  -DOWN  Descending sort order

  Missing data is treated internally as a very
  small number (-1E+10) and will be sorted as such

  WARNING, the RESOL and COL options will mess up
  the index sort order. It is advised to restore
  the old sort order by another call to SORT to
  prevent funny behavior of subsequent options or

  Notice: This option is still in construction. Use it with care!

  OPTION: WINDOW NWIN COL col_id 
  ===============================

  This option creates a new column in which it
  stores a local average of column col_id as
<A NAME="window_nwin"></A>  function of resolution. The average is calculated
  by sorting the reflections by resolution and then
  sliding a window of NWIN reflections along all
  data points in column col_id. The central point
  in the window is set to the average value. For
  the first and last NWIN/2 reflections, which are
  never in the center of the window, the average
  will be obtained by linear extrapolation

 OPTION: WRITE FILENAME [FORMAT] [COLUMN columns] [HEADER]
 =========================================================

 Command to write a structure factor file.

<A NAME="write_filename"></A> -FILENAME is the name of the file. The program
  will try to deduce the file format from the
  extension. It will recognize .mtz, .mdf, .snd,
  .xpl, .tnt, .31, .fin, .phs and .df
<A NAME="write_format"></A> FORMAT can be one of the following:
  MTZ, MDF, SND, XPL, TNT, 31, FIN, PHS or DF
  or a valid FORTRAN format string (see <A HREF="#write_format_fortran">below</A>).
  This overrules the file name extension format
<A NAME="write_column"></A> COLUMN Keyword to select specific columns.
  Columns can be specified by numbers or labels
  (also mixed), and in any order. The order of
  columns in the output file will reflect the
  specified order and not the order in SFTOOLS
  A column may also be given, and therefore
  written, twice (not always allowed, <EM>e.g.</EM> MTZ)
  If no columns are given, then the program will
  ask the user for each column whether or not to
  include it. If no COLUMN keyword is given all
  columns are read.
  THE COLUMN KEYWORD MUST BE THE LAST ARGUMENT !

<A NAME="write_header"></A> HEADER Keyword to specify that only the header
        should be written to the given file

 File formats are:
 MTZ   CCP4 format
 MDF   old BIOMOL format
 SND   BIOMOL ascii format
 XPL   XPLOR format
 TNT   TNT format
 31    PHASES long and short binary formats
 FIN   Xtalview fin-format
 PHS   Xtalview phs-format
 DF    Xtalview double fin-format

 NOTE: several file formats do not allow absent
  data. If one or more written columns of a
  reflection contain absent data then the whole
  reflection is rejected

 NOTE: For .fin and .df files sigma and amplitude
  columns are set to 9999 and 0 respectively if
  the sigma column is 0 or either column contains
  absent data

 NOTE: TNT files can have the following columns
  in the given order:
  Fobs, Sigma
  Fobs, Sigma, Phase, FOM
  Fobs, Sigma, Rfree
  Fobs, Sigma, Rfree, Phase, FOM
  Rfree, if present, MUST be column three.

 NOTE: Only the following columns make sense for
  XPLOR: FOBS, SIGMA, FOM, PHASE, WEIGHT, TEST
         FCALC, FPARTIAL, PA, PB, PC and PD.
  Make sure you write out at most one of each type.
  Use the COLUMN option to prevent the output of
  non-sensible columns. If the first 3 characters
  of a column label match the first 3 characters
  of FOBS, SIGMA, FOM, PHASE, WEIGHT, TEST, FCALC,
  FPARTIAL, PA, PB, PC or PD then SFTOOLS assumes
  that that is the XPLOR column type. If your
  column label does not match any of these, SFTOOLS
  will ask you to specify the XPLOR column type

<A NAME="write_format_fortran"></A> If you provide a Fortran FORMAT string then the
 first three values MUST be written as integers
 since these are the indices. ALL!!! other values
 MUST!!! be written as reals because that is how
 they are stored inside the program

 Examples:
 WRITE myfile.mtz COLUMN 1 2
 (write column 1 and 2 to myfile.mtz as MTZ file)
 WRITE myfile.hkl MTZ COL 2 1
 (write mtz with column 1 and 2 in reversed order)
 WRITE myfile.hkl FORMAT('HKL ',3i5,2f8.3)
 (write four columns in given format)

<H2><A NAME="coltyp"></A>MTZ column types</H2>
<PRE>
Allowed are the following types :

H = index h, k or l   P = phase angle
J = intensity         F = amplitude
D = anom. diff.       Q = standard deviation
W = weight factor     B = batch number
I = any integer       R = any real
A = phase prob. coeff. (Hendrickson/Lattman)
Y = M/ISYM, partial/reject flag and sym. number

<P>Memory requirements are governed by parameters set
in the sftools.inc file, and these may need to be increased for
large problems. The program will inform you if your problem exceeds
the current limits. If the program aborts before any program output
is displayed (you may see a message &quot;killed&quot;) then the array sizes
are set too large to be handled by your computer. You must either
decrease the array sizes, free up or buy more memory, or increase
your swap file.</P>

<P>Program updates in between CCP4 releases will be made available
by the author. Please subscribe to the SFTOOLS users list (by sending
<A HREF="mailto:bart.hazes@ualberta.ca">me</A> an e-mail) or subscribe to the
<A HREF="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4bb.php">CCP4 bulletin board</A> to be notified

<H2><A NAME="history"></A>History</H2>
SFTOOLS was created during 1993 at the university of Groningen while
converting the BIOMOL software package to the MTZ standard. During
the period 1994 till 1998 development was continued a the University
of Alberta. In 1998 SFTOOLS was integrated into the CCP4 program
package.</P>
