<H2><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</H2>
The program analyses TLS tensors and is intended for use with the
output of <a href="refmac5.html">REFMAC</a> or 
<a href="restrain.html">RESTRAIN</a>. It can be used to generate
atomic displacement parameters from the TLS parameters.

<H2><A NAME="files">INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
<H3> TLSIN</H3>
An ASCII file containing details of the TLS groups and the values
of the corresponding T, L and S tensors. Typically, this will correspond
to the TLSOUT file of REFMAC or RESTRAIN. See the
<a href="restrain.html#section3.4">RESTRAIN</a> documentation for 
details of the file format. In addition to the records described
there, the file may contain a line &quot;REFMAC&quot; denoting that
the file has been output from the refinement program
<a href="refmac5.html">REFMAC</a>, which has a different order
of tensor elements.

<H3> XYZIN</H3>
Input coordinates in PDB format. Typically, this will correspond
to the XYZOUT file of REFMAC or RESTRAIN.  ANISOU records are ignored. 
ATOM or HETATM records may contain the full B factor (as output by
RESTRAIN and REFMAC if TLSOUT ADDU is specified) or only the residual B
factor, which doesn't include the contribution from the TLS parameters
(as for REFMAC without TLSOUT ADDU). The program interprets the B
factors according to the keyword <A HREF="#bresid">BRESID</A>.

<H3> XYZOUT </H3>
Output coordinates and anisotropic tensors in PDB format. XYZOUT differs
from XYZIN only in the values of the B factors and the anisotropic
U tensors.
<p>
For atoms which are not in TLS groups but have ANISOU records in XYZIN,
those ANISOU records are written to XYZOUT without change to either the 
ANISOU record or the B factor in the ATOM or HETATM record.
<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> This is a change to the previous behaviour (CCP4 6.1.1 and 
earlier) where no ANISOU records from XYZIN were written to XYZOUT.
<p>
The ATOM records may contain the B factor derived from the TLS parameters,
the residual B factor, or their sum, as determined by the keyword 
<A HREF="#isoout">ISOOUT</A>. Similarly, the ANISOU records may contain 
the anisotropic U tensors derived from the TLS parameters, the residual
B factors expressed as a tensor, or their sum, as determined by the keyword 
<A HREF="#isoout">ISOOUT</A>. The B factor in the ATOM line should always 
correspond to the isotropic component of the anisotropic tensor in the 
ANISOU line.
<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> This is a change to the previous behaviour (CCP4 5.0.2
and earlier) where the ANISOU records contained the full ADPs irrespective 
of the ISOOUT keyword. The ATOM and ANISOU records are now consistent, as 
required by some other programs.

<H3> AXES </H3>

Output file containing the axes for translation, libration,
screw-rotation, reduced translation and non-intersecting
screw-rotation.  By default, the file is in a suitable format for including 
in a MOLSCRIPT <tt>.in</tt> file. The file can also be written in
mmCIF format: this can be used, for example, by CCP4 Molecular Graphics.
See <A HREF="#axes"><B>AXES</B></A> keyword below.

<H3>  SKTOUT </H3>

Output file containing results of several kinds of tests on the TLS 
model (SKTTLS) comparing ADPs for the atoms in bonds between residues.  
The same output is written to the log file after the analysis of 
tensors. The SKTOUT file can be used for plotting with programs such as
gnuplot. See <A HREF="#skttls"><B>SKTTLS Report</B></A> below.


<H2><A NAME="keywords">KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>
<P>Available keywords are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="#aniso"><B>ANISO</B></A>,
<A HREF="#binput"><B>BINPUT</B></A>,
<A HREF="#bresid"><B>BRESID</B></A>,
<A HREF="#isoout"><B>ISOOUT</B></A>,

<A HREF="#end"><B>END</B></A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><A NAME="aniso"></A> ANISO</H3>
Do anisotropic tensor analysis (default: don't). The principal axes of the 
anisotropic tensor are determined for each atom in each TLS group and written
to the log output. If the tensor is non-positive definite, then a warning
is given. Note that the program <a href="anisoanl.html">ANISOANL</a> also
checks for non-positive definite anisotropic tensors, and this may be
more convenient.
The anisotropic tensor includes the isotropic contribution as well
as the contribution from the TLS parameters.

<H3><A NAME="binput"></A> BINPUT [true | t | false | f] </H3>
If true (default), assume PDB file contains isotropic B factors.
Else, assume PDB file contains isotropic U factors (smaller by 8*pi**2).

<H3><A NAME="bresid"></A> BRESID [true | t | false | f] </H3>
If true, assume the ATOM records in XYZIN contain only residual B
factors, and don't include the contribution from the TLS parameters
(this is the case for Refmac if TLSOUT ADDU is <I>not</I> specified). If
false (default), assume the ATOM records contain the full B factor,
including the contribution from TLS (as for Refmac if TLSOUT ADDU is
specified).

<H3><A NAME="isoout"></A> ISOOUT [FULL | RESI | TLSC] </H3>
Determine whether the ATOM and ANISOU records in XYZOUT contain B and U factors 
calculated from the TLS parameters (TLSC), residual B factors (RESI), or the sum
of both (FULL). Default is FULL.

<H3><A NAME="numeric"></A>NUMERIC</H3>
If this keyword is present TLS ranges are assumed to refer to the
monotonically ascending numerical order of residue numbers within each
chain.&nbsp The keyword causes the ATOM & HETATM records in the input
PDB to be first sorted on chain ID and residue number before the TLS
ranges are interpreted (the order in the output PDB file is not
affected).&nbsp The default is the previous behaviour, <I>i.e.</I> to
assume that the TLS ranges refer to the order of residues in the input
PDB file (again within each chain).&nbsp The latter is the PDB
convention for the order of linking residues in the sequence so it seems
logical that this should also be the standard way of referring to the
TLS residue ranges.&nbsp In most cases hopefully the residues in each
chain will already be in monotonically ascending numerical order, in
which case this option will have absolutely no effect!

<H3><A NAME="axes"></A> AXES [FORMAT MOLSCRIPT | MMCIF] [ &lt; scale &gt; ] </H3>

A file (logical name AXES) is output containing the axes for
translation, libration, screw-rotation, reduced translation and
non-intersecting screw-rotation, for each TLS group. All axes are calculated 
in an orthogonal frame with respect to the centre of reaction.  
<p>
By default, or if FORMAT MOLSCRIPT is given, the file is
in a suitable format for including in a MOLSCRIPT <tt>.in</tt>
file. If FORMAT MMCIF is given, the file is written in mmCIF format.
The axes are identified as follows:

<p>
<table border="1">
<TR>
<TH ALIGN=LEFT>Axes</TH>
<TH ALIGN=LEFT>Description in Molscript file</TH>
<TH ALIGN=LEFT>Description in mmCIF file</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>translation T</TD><TD>Translation axes</TD><TD>TRAN</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>libration L</TD><TD>Libration axes</TD><TD>LIB</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>screw tensor S</TD><TD>Screw rotation axes</TD><TD>SCREWROT</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>reduced translation</TD><TD>Reduced translation axes</TD><TD>RTRAN</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>non-intersecting screw axes</TD><TD>Non-intersecting screw axes</TD><TD>SCREW</TD>
</TR>
</table>

<p>
Each axis is written as a pair of coordinates (in the coordinate
system of the input PDB file) representing the beginning and the end
of the axis. For the intersecting axes, the intersection is at the
centre of reaction of the TLS group. The length of each axis is proportional 
to the magnitude of the corresponding motion. The proportionality factor can be
adjusted by the argument &lt; scale &gt;, which defaults to 10.

<H3><A NAME="end"></A> END</H3>
Terminate input.

<H2><A NAME="output"></A>PROGRAM OUTPUT</H2>

For each TLS group included in the file TLSIN, the program outputs information
about the TLS tensors in several representations. Two coordinate origins
are considered:
<ol>
<li>The origin used in refinement, and given by the ORIGIN record in TLSIN.
<li>The centre of reaction, which is the origin that makes S symmetric. 
TLS tensors with respect to this origin are flagged with a prime (').
</ol>
Three axial systems are considered:
<ol>
<li>Orthogonal axes, as used in XYZIN and TLSIN
<li>Libration axes, <EM>i.e.</EM> the principal axes of the L tensor. TLS tensors
in this axial system are flagged with a caret (^).
<li>Rigid-body axes.
</ol>
The values of the T, L and S tensors are given with respect to both
origins, and in the first two axial systems. The L tensor is in general independent of
the origin, and in particular is the same for both origins considered here. In the axial
system defined by the libration axes only, the diagonal elements of 
S are also independent of origin.
<p>
The values of the T and S tensors held in TLSIN thus depend on the origin chosen for
their calculation. The Centre of Reaction, however, is independent of the original
origin, and hence so are quantities calculated with respect to the Centre of Reaction.
<p>
The rigid body motion can also be described as 3 screw motions about 3
non-intersecting axes parallel to the libration axes, together with a 
reduced translation tensor (see <A HREF="#reference2">Schomaker and Trueblood (1968)</A>). 
The program gives the absolute position of these screw axes and the pitch of 
the screw motion along them, followed by the reduced translation tensor.

<H4> <a name="skttls">SKTTLS Report:</a> </H4>

   Several kinds of tests on the TLS model (SKTTLS) are reported following
   the tensor analysis; if a SKTOUT file is given, a copy of this SKTTLS 
   report is also written to that file. Three residuals are calculated for
   each bond between protein or nucleic acid residues:
   <ol>
      <li> CCuij, the correlation of anisotropic ADPs from 
	   <A HREF="#reference3">Merritt (1999)</a>
      (ranges from 1 down); </li>
      <li> rSIMU, residual of the SIMU (BFAC) restraint, rmsd of ANISOU values
      (ranges from 0 up); and </li>
      <li> rDELU, residual of the DELU (RBON) Rosenfeld rigid bond restraint
      (ranges from 0 up). </li>
   </ol>
<p>
   The 95th and 99th percentile values of these three residuals were 
   calculated from a survey of the REFMAC refinements with segmented TLS
   in the PDB as of Sept. 2009. Extreme values of these residuals, <em>e.g.</em>
   CCuij below the 99th percentile, may indicate problems with the ADPs 
   for the atoms in the bond: the TLS segment boundary was
   misassigned, or something went wrong during refinement, or one or both
   atoms have non-positive definite ADPs.
<p>
   The SKTTLS report has summaries and the full table of these residuals
   plus a table of the distribution of anisotropies. Summaries include:
   <ul>
      <li> the number of bonds for which residuals were counted, and the number
      of bonds with any residual beyond the 95th or 99th percentile; </li>
      <li> the mean, standard deviation and worst value of each residual for
      this structure; </li>
      <li> the mean and standard deviation anisotropy for all protein, nucleic
      acid and other non-solvent atoms in this structure; </li>
      <li> a list of up to 100 outliers, bonds in this structure which are
      beyond the 95th percentils for any residual. If there are more than
      100 such outliers, this analysis should be run again after whatever
      caused those problems is fixed. </li>
   </ul>
<p>
   The table of all residuals, SKTTLS TABLE 1, and the table of
   anisotropy distributions, SKTTLS TABLE 2, are formatted for loggraph
   or xloggraph plotting. In addition, the files are formatted so that
   simple extracts of these tables can be plotted by programs such as
   gnuplot: all non-blank lines other than table data lines are prefixed
   with '#' and each table is bracketted by lines of the form:
   <code> "### START OF SKTTLS TABLE N ###" </code> and 
   <code> "### END OF SKTTLS TABLE N ###"</code>. 
<p>
   SKTTLS TABLE 1 contains bond identifiers, TLS group identifiers, and
   residual values. Bond identifiers are residue number, chain ID as text
   and as a number (to facilitate plotting of separate chains in gnuplot)
   and bond name <em>e.g.</em> C1-N2 or, if there are alternate atoms,
   C(A)1-N(A)2. TLS group IDs are TLS group number (numbered sequentially
   from 1 by their order in TLSIN, rather than the given group number)
   and a point at each segment break. The opposite of rDELU is included
   after the residual values so that all 3 residuals can be plotted by
   loggraph with minimal overlapping. The first two lines of the table
   contain values for the 95th and 99th percentile of each residual.
<p>   
   SKTTLS TABLE 2 contains anisotropy bin minimum, maximum and center, and
   fractions and counts for protein, nucleic acid or other non-solvent
   atoms. Non-positive definite ADPs are counted in the first bin, -0.05
   to 0.00; isotropic ADPS are counted in the last bin, 1.00 to 1.00.
<p> 
   SKTTLS TABLE 3 is the list of outliers, containing bond identifiers and
   all three residuals values for each outlying bond. Marks (? or !) show
   which residuals were beyond the 95 or 99th percentile. This table is 
   <b>not</b> formatted for plotting.

<p>
<em>NOTE:</em> This is a change to the previous behaviour (CCP4 6.1.1 and 
earlier) where no ANISOU records from XYZIN were written to XYZOUT.
