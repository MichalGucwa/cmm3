<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>phistats </b>
- Analysis of agreement between phase sets, and checking it against weighting factors.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>phistats </b>
<b>HKLIN</b>
<i>foo_in.mtz </i>

 [<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>]
<H2> <A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>
PHISTATS analyses the differences between two sets of phases.  The
analysis can be binned against two types of weights; for example a
figure of merit, and the magnitude of Fobs.  It is probably more
informative to do map correlation using <A HREF="overlapmap.html">OVERLAPMAP</A>.
<H2> <A NAME="keywords"></A>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>
The various data control lines are identified by keywords.
Only the first 4 characters are significant.
Those available are:

Input column assignments.
The program labels are:

For details of these, see <A HREF="#files">INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</A>. 
<H3> <A NAME="ranges"></A>RANGES &lt;nbin&gt; [ &lt;mon&gt; ]</H3>
Set the number of resolution bins &lt;nbin&gt; and the reflection monitoring
interval &lt;mon&gt;.
<P> 
&lt;nbin&gt; is the number of resolution bins (equal width in
[sin(theta)/(lambda)]**2) in which to divide partial structure data
for normalization and sigmaA estimation.  It is IMPORTANT that
resolution ranges contain sufficient reflections.  It is best to use
as large a value of &lt;nbin&gt; as possible, as long as the estimates of
sigmaA vary smoothly with resolution.  If they do not, &lt;nbin&gt; should
be reduced until sigmaA does vary smoothly.  A good first guess is the
number of reflections divided by 1000.  If sigmaA refinement converges
to zero in one or more of the ranges (which happens sometimes when the
correct value is low), this can usually be circumvented by decreasing
&lt;nbin&gt;.
<P> 
Information about every &lt;nmon&gt;-th reflection will be written to the
log file.
<P> 
Defaults: 20 1000; maximum &lt;nbin&gt; allowed: 50.
<H3> <A NAME="resolution"></A>RESOLUTION [ &lt;rmin&gt; ] &lt;rmax&gt;</H3>
Low and high resolution limits in either order or upper
limit if only one is specified.
These are in Angstroms or, if both are &lt;1.0, units of
4(sin theta/lambda)**2.
By default, all the data in the file are used.

<H3><A NAME="shift"></A>SHIFT &lt;X_fracshift Y_fracshift Z_fracshift&gt;</H3>
<p>PHI2 phases adjusted for a fractional Shift - especially useful when 
the two phase sets refer to different crystal origin:</p>
<PRE>
  PHI2_used = PHI2_input + 2PI(h X_fracshift + k Y_fracshift + l Z_fracshift)
</PRE>


<H3><A NAME="hand"></A>HAND </H3>
<p>PHI2 phases adjusted to change hand. </p>
<PRE>
  PHI2_used = -PHI2_shifted + 2PI(h CX + k CY + l CZ) 
where CX,CY,CZ are the centre of symmetry for this space group. 
(CX,CY,CZ) is (0,0,0) except for spacegroups
I41, I4122, F4132,I4132. See reindexing notes.
</PRE>

<H3> <A NAME="title"></A>TITLE &lt;title&gt;</H3>
A title written to the log file.
<H3> <A NAME="end"></A>END</H3>
End of input.
<H2> <A NAME="files"></A>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
<H3>INPUT</H3>
This is an MTZ file assigned to logical name HKLIN. 
The following column assignments are required:
<dl>
<dt> FP, SIGFP<dd>
native amplitude and standard deviation;
<dt> PHIBP<dd>
first phase (degrees), maybe an isomorphous phase;
<dt> WP<dd>
first `weight' to analyse against, for example, the figure of merit;
<dt> W2<dd>
second `weight' for analysis, for example, the native amplitude.
</dl>
<P> 
PHIB2 may optionally be assigned.  This is the second phase (degrees).
If it is not assigned the program gives the correlation between WP and W2.
<H3> OUTPUT</H3>
There is no output file from this program.
<P> 
Normally the program compares two sets of phases. They can be any set of phases
you like, not just experimental phases against calculated model phases. 
Obviously, if you have calculated phases from a model there is no experimental 
weight. These phases are broken up into those from centric reflections and 
acentric. 
<P> 
Since centric reflections have a limited number of possible values PHISTATS 
compares the agreement between phases. That is if the phases are the same they
agree but if they are different they disagree. Thus if the fraction that agree
is unity then all the centric phases are equivalent.
<P> 
The correlation with the weights is exactly that. The linear correlation 
coefficient is calculated between the phase difference and a weight. It is
calculated twice, once for WP and then W2. This coefficient can range between
1.0 and -1.0. The optimum set of weights would produce a correlation of -1.0
because this would mean that the largest weights would correspond to the 
smallest phase error. The linear correlation coefficient is also calculated 
between weight and cos(phase_difference).
<P> 
There are similar calculations made for acentric reflections, however in this
case a phase error or difference is calculated. Also, an estimated phase 
error is calculated. This is based on the principles used in <A HREF="sigmaa.html">SIGMAA</A> where a
quantity sigma_a is calculated. This is calculated from the two sets of 
structure factor magnitudes and need not be relevant.
<P> 
Tables are produced where these quantities are compared against resolution
and the value of the weight.
