<H1> XIA2 (CCP4: Unsupported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>xia2 </b>
- automated data reduction.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>xia2</b>
<b>-xinfo</b>
<i>project.xinfo</i>

    <p>xia2 is a new automated data reduction system designed to work from raw
      diffraction data and a little metadata, and produce usefully reduced
      data in a form suitable for immediately starting phasing and structure
      solution, e.g. through Mr BUMP or your favourite experimental phasing
      suite.</p>

    <p>The following steps are performed (although not strictly in 
      this order)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Integration with feedback and complex lattice selection stuff</li>
      <li>Reindexing to standard setting for spacegroup (e.g. P 2 21 21 to
	P 21 21 2)</li>
      <li>Scaling together of all data to maximise anomalous signal</li>
      <li>Estimation of number of molecules in ASU and solvent fraction
	based on sequence information (if provided)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is a lot of fun stuff which goes on in there - run it to find 
      out more...</p>
    
    <p>The system is designed to cope with MAD data and data measured in 
      multiple passes, or a combination of the two. The input is a therefore
      a little complex, but consists only of information you should have 
      to hand anyway - here is a simple example, a more complex example 
      can be found below.</p>

    <pre>
! This is a demonstration .xinfo file which illustrates how to cope
! with a simple case - this example is a native cubic insulin data
! set measured on 14.2 at the SRS

! you will probably need to change this - 
! this is the only thing which

! additionally you can add the following 
! information - if it is wrong in the headers
! BEAM x y (mm)
! DISTANCE z (mm)

! this describes the order in which 
! the sweeps were collected - 
! it usually comes from the image header 
! if that information is in there

    <p>This uses test images which are available from the links below. 
      Thanks to John Cowan for providing this test data!</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="demo.zip">Windows (as .zip file)</a></li>
      <li><a href="demo.tar.bz2">Unix (as .tar.bz2 file)</a></li>
      <li><a href="demo.tar.gz">Unix (as .tar.gz file)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are a couple of templates - for native data from two sweeps, 
      SAD data from one sweep, MAD data from three wavelengths - all 
      you need to do is select an appropriate one and add your own
      information! Please note - if you wish to comment something out
      from a .xinfo file, simply at a "!" at the beginning 
      of the appropriate lines.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="NATIVE.xinfo">Native data</a></li>
      <li><a href="SAD.xinfo">SAD data</a></li>
      <li><a href="MAD.xinfo">MAD data</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>More examples can be found in $DPA_ROOT/examples. Remember - you need 
      to tell xia2 where to find your data! Answers to frequently asked
      questions can be found <a href="faq.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>To assist in generating the .xinfo file I have written a small
      program xia2setup, which is passed in the directory where your data
      are stored, and will write to the standard output an illustrative
      .xinfo file. This will number the wavelengths and sweeps, and so 
      will not add sensible information, and will get all of it's information
      from the image headers, which are sometimes unreliable.</p>
    
    <p>The new program is run thus:</p>

    <pre>
xia2setup -atom se -project foo -crystal bar \
-beam 109,105 /path/to/image/directory > automatic.xinfo
    </pre>

    <p>This will look for sequence files (.seq) scan files (.scan) and
      images files (.img, .osc, .mar345, .mccd, .cbf) and make a good
      guess as to what is going on. If you have a scan file in there and
      you have chooch installed, then xia2 will have a stab at identifying
      the different wavelengths. This is a guess and may be wrong. For this
      to work I have made the following assumptions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All images are from one crystal only.</li>
      <li>The scan, if present, was the one used to select the wavelengths 
	for data collection. If more than one is present, the alphabetically
	latest one will be used.</li>
      <li>The sequence file, if present, should be in the one letter form
	and all comment lines should begin with a character not in A-Z.
	Again the alphabetically latest sequence file will be used.</li>
      <li>If the sequence file is provided, and the atom is "se", then
	xia2setup will assume that you are doing a SeMet experiment
	and will provide an appropriate number of atoms per monomer - though
	<b>you will still have to uncomment this</b> to include it,
	in case it has guessed wrong.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you want to combine data from a number of crystals in the same
      .xinfo file, then you will need to copy out all text from
      BEGIN CRYSTAL to END CRYSTAL from one .xinfo file to the other.</p>
    
    <p>You should then load automatic.xinfo in your favourite editor, and 
      check that the sequence looks correct and that the names are sensible
      as well as checking that the epoch numbers are set correctly and
      also that the wavelengths and beam centres are correct. If you 
      provided a heavy atom there is a place to say how many to look for.</p>

    <p>Finally, if you have labelit installed xia2setup will run this 
      to update the beam positions. If this happens, you will see a comment
      to this effect above the BEAM records in the sweeps.</p>
    
    <h1>Platforms</h1>
    
    <p>The following platforms are supported (see notes at bottom of page
      for platform specific advice.)</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>GNU/Linux on i386 (and 64 bit extensions)</li>
      <li>OS X 10.4 i386 and Power PC G4/G5</li>
      <li>Microsoft Windows 2000/XP (Vista doesn't work - problem with 
	the mosflm SPOTOD file - currently investigating)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Supported Detector Types</h1>
    
    <p>The following detectors are supported:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>ADSC CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR 345 image plates</li>
      <li>RAXIS IV image plates</li>
      <li>Rigaku Saturn CCDs (Binned and unbinned)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>If you have another detector class which needs support, please get 
      in touch.</p>

    <h1>Requirements</h1>

    <p>The only software which is actually required is CCP4 6.0.1/2 and Python
      2.4.x. On Windows the PyWin32 module is also required, to provide
      additional process control functionality. If you are using this 
      on a Windows platform and wish to be able to use the integration
      functionality, you should get in touch with Harry Powell for a custom
      build of Mosflm.</p>

    <p>In addition the autoindexing program Labelit is supported but the 
      system will work without it. If it is installed (and it should be a 
      moderately recent version) then it will be used for autoindexing.</p>

    <h1>License</h1>

    <p>This software is distributed under the BSD license for all users.
      Everyone who uses this software is invited to join the xia2bb
      mailing list. Finally, if you use this software in solving a structure
      which is published, please acknowledge it! Thanks!</p>

    <p>A copy of the license is available <a href="license.html">here
      </a>.</p>

    <p>This software depends upon CCP4 and will also make use of Labelit - 
      users are reminded that it is their responsibility to have properly
      obtained licenses for this software.</p>

    <h1>Usage</h1>

    <p>Once the software is installed, the first thing you need to do is 
      prepare a .xinfo file (example above) to run from. This contains a 
      description of the experiment, which will allow xia2 to decide how to 
      handle your data and what information to put in the MTZ headers.</p>
      
    <p>Essentially the input file just needs a description of the data
      which were collected from each crystal - for instance, if you measured
      three MAD wavelengths, a peak, inflection and high remote, then 
      there should be three WAVELENGTH blocks in the file, containing the 
      fp, fpp and wavelength values. The images that you measured from these
      should then be described in the SWEEP block, which is then assigned to 
      a wavelength. This structure simplifies handling of multiple passes
      contributing to one wavelength. In the reduced output, the wavelength 
      names will correspond to MTZ datasets. If you are interested in 
      keeping the harvesting information, and you have more than one crystal
      to process in a single xia2 run, you will need to ensure that the 
      WAVELENGTH names are globally unique within the input file.</p>
    
    <p>The program is actually run with:</p>

    <pre>
xia2 -xinfo project.xinfo
    </pre>
    
    <p>And all data reduction is performed in the working directory, with the
      a directory structure CRYSTAL/WAVELENGTH/SWEEP. Interesting log files
      can be found in the CRYSTAL/scale directory.</p>

    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

    <p>Development of xia2 is supported by the BBSRC e-HTPX grant and the 
      EU framework 6 BioXHit initiative. xia2 makes extensive use of Phil 
      Evans's program Pointless, and I would like to thank him for the 
      extensive modifications made to the program. I would also like to thank
      the US structural genomics JCSG group for providing their extensive
      collection of raw diffraction data to methods developers. Finally I 
      would like to acknowledge CCP4, for without their software this project
      would go nowhere!</p>

    <h1>The More Complex Example</h1>

    <p>This example has two crystals, one of which is selenomethionated,
      with two wavelengths (inflection and low remote) measured for the 
      derivative and two native sweeps measured for the native sample.
      Lines beginning with # or ! will be treated as comments.</p>

    <p>This is a particularly complex example, but it illustrates the 
      capability of the system well. There are data from two crystals, one 
      native and the other selenomethionated. The native set is measured in 
      two sweeps. Currently (version 0.2.6.3) no attempt is made to combine 
      data from multiple crystals, however this is on the to-do list.</p>
    
    <h1>Release Notes</h1>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.6.2</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Now works for images with long image numbers, as typically 
	recorded on Rigaku X-Ray sets.</li>
      <li>Signed off for operation with Rigaku Saturn and RAXIS IV
	detectors.</li>
      <li>Now works with no input, e.g.
	<pre>
xia2 -project TG6623 -crystal X77788 -atom se /my/images/are/here
	</pre>
	However this relies on your image headers being accurate and the
	images having some kind of recognisable format...
      </li>
      <li>Repaired operation on ppc and intel macs - added required libraries
	to the installation and reset the library paths appropriately.</li>
      <li>Slightly improved error reporting from xinfo file errors.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Changes since 0.2.6.1</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Now carefully select the images to use for cell refinement based
	on the orientation of the crystal lattice.</li>
      <li>Fixed numerous bugs to do with the naming of the detector class
	which changed in the previous version.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.6.0</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed bug where if the distance was read incorrectly from the 
	image header (or was wrong therein) XDS would get the wrong value
	even if you had put the correct value in the .xinfo file.</li>
      <li>Now "unroll" the unmerged reflections from XSCALE and then 
	merge them in their original sweeps in Scala. This should give
	a useful Rmerge vs. time plot.</li>
      <li>Including updated versions of Pointless and Scala.</li>
      <li>Includes new and more robust handling of pointgroups, lattices
	and unstable refinement of parameters during integration.</li>
      <li>Include support for a reference reflection file, which will 
	ensure that the reflections are indexed in the same way and 
	with the same spacegroup - useful for mutants.</li>
      <li>Now always use three wedges of images for the cell refinement
	with Mosflm as this makes the lattice elimination more reliable.
      </li>
      <li>If one of the images in a sweep is broken (e.g. corrupted) 
	xia2 will tell you more helpfully rather than just crashing.</li>
      <li>Now correctly read distance from Mar 165 images. Thanks to 
	Francois Remacle for this fix to DiffractionImage.</li>
      <li>Fixed the use of xia2 -3d with RAXIS IV detectors.</li>
      <li>Use more images for Mosflm autoindexing (three instead of two)
	as this gives uniformly better results.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.5.2</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Now works for highly incomplete data sets, so long as you 
	have either 4 times the mosaic spread or 8 images, whichever
	is the larger. This is to allow pointgroup identification 
	from e.g. the first 10 images in a data set - designed to assist
	in synchrotron / lab source data collection.</li>
      <li>Now include the latest Mosflm binaries in the extras package - 
	these are often better than those in the CCP4 distribution,
	as they come directly from Harry Powell's web page.</li>
      <li>Added -ehtpx_xml_out option which will write out marked
	up metadata about the data reduction, for inclusion in the
	e-HTPX data reduction portal and, perhaps, other automated
	systems. Usage:
	<pre>
xia2 -ehtpx_xml_out project.xml
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li>If data are very incomplete (e.g. less than 50% complete) then don't 
	try to refine the error parameters. This is both incorrect and a 
	waste of time.</li>
      <li>Renamed the output reflection files - these are now in DataFiles
	directory with names like "PROJECT_CRYSTAL_free.mtz." This makes
	them a little easier to identify.</li>
      <li>Harvesting (deposition) files now in subdirectory of Harvest
	rather than being spread around the place. These will have 
	names Harvest/DepositFiles/PROJECT/WAVELENGTH.scala etc.</li>
      <li><b>Have now fixed xia2setup so it works much more sensibly - 
	  the decision about when a new sweep starts was a little broken
	  (rounding errors issue) now fixed!</b></li>
      <li>Added -parallel flag to work when using XDS for data reduction.</li>
      <li><b>Added XDS support!</b> This is however much less mature than
	the support for Mosflm/CCP4. It is also worth noting that this 
	relies on many CCP4 tools.</li>
      <li>Added selection of the "pipeline" to use through a command line 
	option, either -2d for mosflm/ccp4 or -3d for xds/xscale though 
	the latter still uses a number of CCP4 programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.5.1 - big changes in <b>bold</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Process data as native if no heavy atom information, only one 
	  wavelength specified and no anomalous scattering form factors
	  provided. Otherwise separate anomalous pairs for scaling.</b></li>
      <li><b>Added a -quick option to the xia2 command line, which will
	  cut out many of the data reduction optimisation steps (not 
	  refine detector parameters, resolution or scaling parameters)
	  but will still include everything else. This is to allow quick
	  characterisation of data at the beamline, and perhaps map 
	  calculation?</b></li>
      <li>Correctly print the unmerged scalepack file name for single
	wavelength data.</li>
      <li>Perform radiation damage analysis using R merge and B factor
	as a function of <i>time</i> - note that this is not <i>batch.</i>
	This is likely to have interesting side-effects.</li>
      <li>If time of data collection not recorded in header <i>but</i>
	the time stamp for the images are correct (e.g. you have not moved
	them since collection) then the command line flag
	<pre>-trust_timestamps</pre> can be used, which will use the 
	time stamps on the image files to analyse things like radiation
	damage.</li>
      <li>If you are running this on a cluster, have added an option 
	to migrate the diffraction data to a local disk (e.g. /tmp.)
	To do this add <pre>-migrate_data</pre> to the command line - 
	the data will be removed from the local disk once the processing
	is finished.</li>
      <li>Copy all final reflection files to a DataFiles directory.</li>
      <li>Now, when something goes horribly wrong, just write the actual
	message to the screen and the horrible stack trace gunk to a file
	called xia2.error. This should be sent in for error reports!</li>
      <li>Remerge individual wavelengths to get the merging statistics to
	the most appropriate resolution limit, rather than the furthest
	extent of any data, for the summary table.</li>
      <li>If GAIN included in SWEEP block, will be used as the default
	value for integration. E.g. GAIN 0.25.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.5</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed problem with spacegroup R3:H (naming convention problem
	- there's a surprise.)</li>
      <li>GAIN estimation temporarily removed.</li>
      <li>Pointgroup evaluation fixed - found a <b>major</b> gremlin in 
	there</li>
      <li>Allow environment variables and tilde in DIRECTORY token:
	<pre>DIRECTORY $DATA/example or ~/data or %DATA%/example (win32)</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Now tracks the citations for the programs used, writing them
	to the standard output in plain text and to xia-citations.bib
	in BIBTeX format.</li>
      <li>Removed [XIA2] tokens from standard output - the reason for 
	having this there no longer applies.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>Changes since 0.2.4</p>

    <ul>
      <li>xia2setup will now add the f', f'' values if a scan is available
	and has been processed by chooch</li>
      <li>GAIN now estimated by diffdump - enabling future parallelisation 
	of the integration stage.</li>
      <li>For detectors formed as a mosaic of a number of tiles, with "gaps"
	in between, now mask those gapped areas in Mosflm to reduce the
	number of bad reflections.</li>
      <li>Now has a fix for the ongoing indexing problem which gave rise 
	to errors like "something horrible has happened in indexing".</li>
      <li>The "best" log file for each process will now be recorded in a
	LogFiles directory - which means no more hunting around for the 
	final scala log file and what not.</li>
      <li>Chaling now produces unmerged reflection files in scalepack format
	as well as merged scalepack and merged MTZ format. This is done by 
	scala (if used) by recycling the final SCALES and adding 
	"output polish unmerged."</li>
      <li>Now runs a twinning test using the CCP4 program sfcheck, and
	will warn you if your data look twinned.</li>
      <li>Now allow up to 100 cycles of scale refinement to cope with 
	more extreme cases where data at very different resolutions
	are scaled together.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.3</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- <li>Added support for XDS</li> -->
      <li>Added <a href="preferences.html">preferences file</a></li>
      <li>Added xia2setup program to create the .xinfo file - this will 
	also run LABELIT to configure the beam centre if it is installed</li>
      <li>Added a strategy-of-data-reduction step to the pipeline</li>
      <li>Added run-time check that CCP4 and so on are available</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.2.4:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Changed to a BSD license</li>
      <li>Added "python setup" check to xia2</li>
      <li>Relaxed criteria on isomorphism to 1% not 0.5A etc.</li>
      <li><b>Now wavelengths in wavelength record will override header
	values if provided, but do not (indeed, should not) be included
	if wavelength values are correct.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.2.3:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Created version for Power PC G4/G5</li>
      <li>Fixed .csh setup scripts</li>
      <li>If wavelength values not specified in the .xinfo file will use
	values from the image headers</li>
      <li>If loggraph output from scala is broken by having Mn(I/sigma)
	greater than 99.99 can now cope (ignores that record)</li>
      <li>Will now use a maximum of 180 degrees of data for deciding 
	e.g. the point group, spacegroup and correct indexing standards -
	this helps the cases where exceptionally high redundancy data 
	has been measured</li>

    <p>Changes since 0.2.2.2:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Updated printheader to cope with MAR 165</li>
      <li>Cleaner error messages when data missing</li>
      <li>Added support for MAR image plate data</li>
      <li>Included more example .xinfo files in the examples directory</li>
      <li>Relaxed refinement parameters in Mosflm cell refinement</li>

    <h1>Platform Specific Advice</h1>

    <h2>Gfortran compiled CCP4</h2>

    <p>Recent versions of the gcc compiler suite have included a new compiler
      called "gfortran" in place of "g77". This has, unfortunately, been 
      designed with buffering too high on the agenda, and the output
      from programs can sometimes be mashed. If this happens you need to
      set "GFORTRAN_UNBUFFERED_ALL" to 1 in your environment.</p>

    <h2>Linux</h2>
    
    <p>There should be no particular problems on this platform - assuming
      that you have a recent version of Python. Any 2.4 version should work,
      but I have mostly used 2.4.3 and 2.4.4, and would recommend them.
      If the version you have on your system by default (type "python"
      to find out what version you have)is too old, you can easily install
      a new version, perhaps in the xia directory, from 
      <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/">here</a>.
      This is best installed by unpacking the tarball (tar xvfz 
      Python-2.4.4.tgz) then doing ./configure /where/I/want/it then
      make, make install.</p>

    <h2>OS X 10.4</h2>

    <p>The only potential problem with this platform is that the Python 
      which comes as standard is 2.3 - however a universal binary is 
      available from 
      <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/">here</a>,
      which should sort out any problems. Just follow the instructions in 
      the disk image.</p>

    <h2>Windows XP</h2>

    <p>Once more you will need a recent version of Python - which can be found
      <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.4.4/">here</a>,
      however, you will also need "pywin32" to provide a little more
      job control functionality - this is available from 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">here</a>. Both are
      simple, double-click, binary installers.</p>
    <p>There is now a version of Labelit available for Windows, which 
      can be found <a href="http://adder.lbl.gov/labelit/">here.</a></p>
    <p>The mosflm binary which comes with 
      <a href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/harry/imosflm/index.html">
	iMosflm</a> works well with xia2.</p>
