<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>`fffear' is a package which searches for molecular fragments in
poor quality electron density maps. It was inspired by the Uppsala
`ESSENS' software (Kleywegt+Jones, 1997), but achieves greater speed
and sensitivity through the use of Fast Fourier transforms, maximum
likelihood, and a mixed bag of mathematical and computational
approaches (Cowtan, 1998). Currently, the main application is the
detection of helices in poor electron density maps (5.0A or better),
and the detection of beta strands in intermediate electron density
maps (4.0A or better).  It is also possible to use electron density as
a search model, allowing the location of NCS elements. Approximate
matches may be refined, and translation searches may be performed
using a single orientation. The results are scored using an agreement 
function based on the mean squared difference between model and map over 
a masked region. </P>

<p>The program takes as input an mtz file containing the Fourier
coefficients of the map to be searched, and a search model in the form
of a pdb file, map, or maximum likelihood target. A `fragment mask' is
generated to cover the fragment density, and orientations and
translations are searched to find those transformations which give a
good fit between the fragment density and map density within the
fragment mask.</P>

<p>The program has been highly optimised using reciprocal-space
rotations and grid-doubling FFT's, and crystallographic symmetry
(Rossman+Arnold, 1993) giving 4-50 times speed improvement over the
results published in 1998. The speed of the calculation is almost
independent of the size of the model, thus the program may also be
used for molecular replacement calculations where weak phases are
available.</p>

<p>A maximum likelihood search function is under consideration for
future versions.</p>


<H3>`fffear' Recipes</H3>

For a map with 3.5A phases try something like this:
<pre>
fffear hklin ~/hkl/gmto-unique.mtz xyzin alpha-helix-10.pdb xyzout alpha10-rot.pdb &lt;&lt; eof
<!-- this code is invalid unless viewed in a browser -->
SOLC 0.35
SEARCH STEP 10
RESO 1000.0 3.5
CENTRE ORTH   7.464  16.169  16.893
LABI FP=FP SIGFP=SIGFP PHIO=PHIB FOMO=FOM
END
eof
</pre>

At 5.0A some of the fragment density is no longer localised. This can
cause a mismatch between the fragment and protein density. One
solution is to use the 'FILTER MAP' keyword to match the map and
fragment densities. A better option is to use the 5.0A maximum
likelihood search target. The search target is provided on MAXIN, a
model is also provided for visualisation purposes only:

<pre>
fffear hklin ~/hkl/gmto-unique.mtz maxin ml-helix-9-5.0A.max xyzin ml-helix-9.pdb xyzout alpha10-rot.pdb &lt;&lt; eof
<!-- this code is invalid unless viewed in a browser -->
SOLC 0.35
SEARCH STEP 15
RESO 1000.0 5.0
FILTER MAP RADIUS 6.0
CENTRE ORTH   7.464  16.169  16.893
LABI FP=FP SIGFP=SIGFP PHIO=PHIB FOMO=FOM
END
eof
</pre>

When the search model is large (i.e. molecular replacement
calculations or density fragment searches to find NCS of
cross-crystal operators), the search can be foiled by long range
variations in either the map or fragment density. In this case
filtering should be applied to both the map and the search model:

<pre>
fffear hklin ~/hkl/rnase-unique.mtz mapin rnase-mol.map &lt;&lt; eof
<!-- this code is invalid unless viewed in a browser -->
SOLC 0.35
SEARCH STEP 15
MASK RADI 2.5
RESO 1000.0 5.0
FILTER MAP MODEL RADIUS 6.0
CENTRE ORTH   7.464  16.169  16.893
LABI FP=FP SIGFP=SIGFP PHIO=PHIB FOMO=FOM
END
eof
</pre>

In the case of molecular replacement calculation and NCS searches it
is important that the search model and map should be scaled correctly:
<ol>

<li>To perform molecular replacement with a sharpened model (like the
supplied helix fragments), no SCALE keyword is required. Ensure all
the B-factors in the input pdb are set to 0.00.

<li>To perform molecular replacement with a natural-B model, specify
SCALE NATURAL.

<li>To perform an NCS search with density cut from the same map, both
maps will be on the same scale already, so you must specify SCALE 1.0
0.0.

<li>To refine the result of an MR or NCS search, use the MODEL ROTATE
keyword with the approximate orientation, and change the SEARCH STEP
and RANGE.
</ol>

FILTER MAP is useful in all three cases to match the mean of the map
and the fragment.

<H2><A NAME="files"></A>INPUT/OUTPUT FILES</H2>

The structure factors and estimated phases must be provided in
HKLIN. The search model must be specified by an coordinate model or
map fragment in XYZIN or MAPIN.

<H3>HKLIN<A NAME="hklin"></A></H3>

<P>Input mtz file - This should contain the conventional (CCP4) asymmetric
unit of data (see CAD).</P>

<P>The mtz file should contain all reflections to the limit of the
measured diffraction pattern, since all the reflections are used to
accurately scale the data. However, only those reflection with phases,
to the resolution limit specified by the compulsory RESOLUTION
keyword, will actually be used in the search procedure.</P>

<H3>XYZIN<A NAME="xyzin"></A></H3>

<P>Input pdb file. This may contain an arbitrary crystal header, or
none at all. The only restriction is that the atomic coordinates are
given in Angstroms on arbitrary orthogonal axes. The B-factors of the
input atoms should be set to an average value of (around)
zero. Normally, all B-factors should be equal, unless some prior
information about the B-factors of atoms in the desired fragment is
available. (It is legitimate for example to make the B-factors of the
C-beta or Oxygen atoms higher).</P>

<H3>MAPIN<A NAME="mapin"></A></H3>

<P>Input map file. This may be specified as an alternative to XYZIN to
perform a search for NCS or cross-crystal operators. The map should
contain the search density, placed in a cubic cell. Regions of the map
outside the search mask should be set to zero. The search map will
usually be generated using <A HREF="maprot.html">maprot</A> in map
cutting mode, e.g.
<small><blockquote><pre>
maprot wrkin rnase-mir.map mskin rnase-mol.msk cutout rnase-mol.map &lt;&lt; eof
MODE TO
CELL UNIT 100 100 100 90 90 90
GRID UNIT 150 150 150
AVER 1
ROTA POLAR 0 0 0
TRAN 0 0 0
eof
</pre></blockquote></small>
If the input map is calculated for the same structure factors which
are given to fffear, the scaling can be overridden using
<tt>SCALE&nbsp;1.0&nbsp;0.0</tt>.
</P>
<P>
An input coordinate file may also be provided on XYZIN. This will not
be used for the search, but will be rotated and output for
visualisation purposes.
</P>

<H3>MAXIN<A NAME="maxin"></A></H3>

<P>Input maximum likelihood search target. This is used in the same
way as an input map, however it also contains density variance
information. (Special software is used for the construction of ML
targets for fffear). ML targets are resolution dependent, so the
appropriate target should be used in conjunction with the RESOLUTION
keyword. XYZIN may again be used for visualisation purposes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="xyzout"></A>XYZOUT</H3>

<p>Output pdb file. This contains multiple copies of the input
fragment, rotated and translated to the positions of the best matches
between the fragment density and and map density. The fragments are
sorted in order of quality, with the best first. The b-factor is set
to the value of the search function, with low values representing a
good fit.</p>

<p>Good matches to major secondary structure features are usually
obvious because several fragments link up or overlap in sensible
manners. At better than 4.0A resolution, the direction of the chain is
commonly correct as well.</p>

<p>The output pdb file may be further analysed with `ffjoin'.</p>

<H3><A NAME="mapout"></A>MAPOUT</H3>

<p>A map of the best fragment fit at each position in the map. Values
closest to zero represent the best fit.</p>

<H3><A NAME="solin"></A>SOLIN</H3>

<P>Input mask - this is used as a filter for the results. Any
rotation/translation solutions whose centre-of-mass falls in the
solvent (zero) region of the mask will be excluded from the output.
If no mask is given, the whole cell is allowed.
</P>

<P>Generally there is no point providing a solvent mask, since the
solvent density generally does not provide a match to atomic
features. However this may be useful when fitting a molecular
replacement map from a very incomplete model, to exclude hits to the
MR model.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="resolution"></A>RESOLUTION &lt;rmin&gt; &lt;rmax&gt; </H3>

<P>Resolution range of reflections to include in the translation
search stage of the calculation. This should be set to cover the
resolution range for which significant phase information is
available. Good results are obtained with phases to 4.0A or better;
for larger fragments (10 residues or more) information may be obtained
at still lower resolutions. <BR> (default is the whole range of the
input mtz file)
</P>

<H3><A NAME="model"></A>MODEL [RADIUS &lt;mdlrad&gt;] [RESOLUTION &lt;mrmax&gt;] [BFACTOR &lt;bfac&gt;] [ROTATE &lt;alpha&gt; &lt;beta&gt; &lt;gamma&gt;] </H3>

<P>Set the parameters for the model atoms.
<dl>
<dt>&lt;mdlrad&gt;<dd>is the radius over which the atomic density is
calculated (as VDWR in sfall).
<dt>&lt;mrmax&gt;<dd> is the resolution at which the atomic shape
functions are calculated. At higher resolutions this should make
little difference, however at lower resolutions a significant amount
of the atomic density leaks out of the fragment mask, and so better
results are obtained if the atomic shape function is corrected.
If &lt;mrmax&gt; is set to zero, resolution truncation is disabled
and the true shape function is used.
<dt>&lt;bfac&gt;<dd> Temperature factor to add to all the atoms in the input
fragment. By default the search is conducted in a map sharpened to
Boverall=0. If a different type of map is used through use of the
SCALE card, the B-factors of the model atoms should be adjusted
accordingly.
<dt>&lt;alpha&gt; &lt;beta&gt; &lt;gamma&gt;<dd> An initial rotation
to apply to the model before starting the search. This rotation is
included in the output rotation angles. Useful for doing a translation
search at fixed orientation, or for refining an MR solution.
</dl>
Defaults: &lt;mdlrad&gt;=2.5A, &lt;mrmax&gt;=&lt;rmax&gt;,
&lt;bfac&gt;=0, &lt;alpha&gt;=&lt;beta&gt;=&lt;gamma&gt;=0.</P>

<H3><A NAME="mask"></A>MASK [RADIUS &lt;mskrad&gt;] </H3>

<P>Set the radius of the fragment mask about the model atoms. This
determines the volume over which the agreement between the map and the
model are compared. Defaults: &lt;mskrad&gt;=2.5A.</P>

<H3><A NAME="filter"></A>FILTER [MAP] [MODEL] [VARIANCE] [RADIUS
&lt;fltrad&gt;] </H3>

<P>Apply a filter to the map and/or model before starting the
search. The filter may match either the local mean (default) within
the filter radius, or it may match both the local mean and
variance. This is useful at low resolutions or when performing MR or
NCS searches.
<dl>
<dt>MAP<dd> apply filter to map.
<dt>MODEL<dd> apply filter to search model.
<dt>VARIANCE<dd> match both local mean and variance.
<dt>&lt;fltrad&gt;<dd> radius of sphere for local mean/variance calculation.
</dl>Defaults: do not filter either map or model, do not match
variance, &lt;fltrad&gt;=5.0A</P>

<H3><A NAME="search"></A>SEARCH [STEP &lt;step&gt;] [RANGE &lt;beta&gt;] [PEAKS &lt;npeaks&gt;] [GRID &lt;sampling&gt;]</H3>

<P>Set the parameters for the search function.
<dl>
<dt>&lt;step&gt;<dd> is the orientation step angle in degrees. At 4.0A
resolution or better, a search step of 10 degrees is sufficient for a
10 residue fragment. The search step should be smaller at higher
resolutions or for larger models. A quick and dirty result may often
be obtained with a much coarser search step, as large as 30
degrees.
<dt>&lt;range&gt;<dd> Set the maximum range in degrees for the
search. To perform a translation search on a single orientation, set
&lt;range&gt; to 0.1. To refine the result of a previous search, use
SEARCH STEP 2 RANGE 10 and give the approximate orientation with MODEL
ROTATE.
<dt>&lt;npeaks&gt;<dd> is the number of peaks in the resulting search
function for which rotated fragment atoms will be output.  Defaults:
&lt;step&gt;=10degrees, &lt;npeaks&gt;=100.
<dt>&lt;sampling&gt;<dd> is the factor by which the search grid is oversampled. Higher values give finer search grids, and potentially better results at the cost of time. Default: &lt;sampling&gt;=1.333.
</dl>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="scale"></A>SCALE [NATURAL] [&lt;scale&gt; &lt;bfac&gt;] </H3>

<P>Override internal scaling and scale input data by:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;&lt;scale&gt;&nbsp;exp&nbsp;(&lt;bfac&gt;&nbsp;s/2)&nbsp;F<sub>obs</sub><sup>2</sup><br>
Scaling is critical to correctly fitting the density with a model. The
data scale will be accurately determined automatically if structure
factor magnitudes are provided to better than 4.5A, otherwise it is a
good idea to provide a SCALE card. 
<dl>
<dt>NATURAL<dd>place the map on an absolute scale but do not adjust the B-factor.
</dl>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="centre"></A>CENTRE FRAC/ORTH &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; </H3>

<P>Center the output fragment positions in an asymmetric unit around
&lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt;, given in fractional or orthogonal
coordinates in accordance with the preceding keyword. Useful to put
your matches in the same region and any model you are working on.</p>


</table></div>


<H2><A NAME="keywords_other"></A>OTHER KEYWORDS</H2> Don't use these
unless you really know what you are doing. In which case you'd better
have a better idea of what you are doing than I do.

<H3><A NAME="grid"></A>GRID &lt;nx&gt; &lt;ny&gt; &lt;nz&gt;</H3>

<P>Set the grid for the calculation. Ideally the grid spacing should
be 1/5 of the resolution of the phases, thus for 4.0A phases the grid
spacing must be 0.8A. Spacings greater than 1/4 of the resolution will
cause an error. Grid sampling must be a multiple of 4 and obey any
other requirements imposed by the spacegroup.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="form"></A>FORM &lt;z&gt; &lt;a1&gt; &lt;b1&gt; &lt;a2&gt; &lt;b2&gt; </H3>

<P>Alternate 2-gaussian formfactor coefficient for atomic number
&lt;z&gt;.
f=&lt;a1&gt;exp(&lt;b1&gt;s)+&lt;a2&gt;exp(&lt;b2&gt;s). Formfactors
are supplied for H, N, C, O, S and other atom types are scaled from
these. Given that the model B-factors will generally be wrong, a crude
approximation is sufficient for all common cases.</P>

<H3><A NAME="truncate"></A>TRUNCATE &lt;rmin&gt; &lt;rmax&gt; </H3>

<P>Resolution range of reflections to include in the data scaling
stage. This keyword can be used to exclude part of the input data by
resolution cutoffs. This is generally highly inadvisable.<BR> (default
is the whole range of the input mtz file)</P>

<H3><A NAME="strucfac"></A>STRUCFAC [REAL &lt;rscale&gt;] [RECIP &lt;hscale&gt;] </H3>

<P>Use a (slow) direct Fourier to calculate the model and mask
structure factors instead of the default FFT. The REAL and RECIP
keywords may then be used to set the spacing of the real space grid
used to calculate the fragment density and mask, and the reciprocal
space sampling of the fragment and mask transforms.
<dl>

<dt>&lt;rscale&gt;
<dd>The spacing in Angstroms of the grid on which the fragment model density
and mask are calculated. Default 0.5 A.

<dt>&lt;hscale&gt;
<dd>The spacing in reciprocal Angstroms of the grid on which the
fragment and mask transforms (structure factors) are calculated. This
grid needs to be quite fine to ensure accurate interpolation when the
fragment transform is related. The default value is sufficient for a
model whose longest axis is 15A, for larger models decrease this
number proportionally. Default 0.01 A<sup>-1</sup>.

</dl>
</P>


</small></table></div>

<H2>OUTPUT</H2>

<P>The output PDB file (XYZOUT) contains up to 1000 copies of the
input molecule in decreasing order of fit to the density. For the
purposes of visualisation I find it useful to get the header and the
first 250 C-alpha atoms from this file, as follows:

<br><tt>grep 'C[AR]' XYZOUT | head -250 > ca.pdb</tt>
</P>

<P>The translation function map (which omits the orientation
information) is also output on MAPOUT. This has peaks where the
origins of the good orientations are found. If the input model has an
alpha carbon at the origin a rough backbone trace of map regions
matching the fragment may be obtained.
