<p>The Data Harvesting paradigm, pioneered by Kim Henrick at the
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) has been under development for
a number of years and is in operation in users' labs. Background
information can be found in two earlier Newsletter articles: an <a
href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/newsletters/newsletter35/dataharvest.html"
TARGET="_EXTERNAL">overview of data harvesting,</a> and a <a
href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/newsletters/newsletter36/03_harvest.html"
TARGET="_EXTERNAL">report on the September 1998 Joint CCP4/EBI
software developers and Data Harvesting Workshop.</a> The concept of
data harvesting, within CCP4, implies the collection of various
relevant pieces of information obtained during the different steps
from structure solution, into a collection of files. These files are
then deposited into a database, for example the PDB, along with the
final model coordinates to provide a full characterisation of the
methods used and results and statistics obtained from the experiment.

<H2><A NAME="definition"></A><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Definition and application of datasets</FONT></H2>
<p>Data harvesting uses the concept of "datasets". A particular
dataset is identified by a Project Name / Dataset Name pair. The
Project Name specifies the structure solution project, and is
equivalent to what will become a PDB ID code (or in mmCIF terms the
_entry.id ). The Dataset Name identifies the particular dataset within
the project (either X-ray diffraction structure factors or NMR
experimentally determined data) that is being used ( _diffrn.id in
mmCIF). Thus, a particular structure solution may involve several
datasets with the same Project Name but distinguished by different 
Dataset Names (e.g. for native and heavy atom derivatives, or for 
different wavelengths in a MAD experiment). Alternatively, one may have
several datasets for an apoprotein and its complexes, and these would
be distinguished by different Project Names since they correspond to
different structure solutions.</P>

<P>Every harvest deposition file should have associated in-house tags that 
identify the &quot;Project Name&quot; and &quot;Dataset Name&quot;. For each
program that writes out a deposition file, it is possible to specify
the Project and Dataset names using the program keywords <A HREF="#pname" TARGET="_self">PNAME</A> and <A HREF="#dname" TARGET="_self">DNAME</A>.
In principle, however, the Project and Dataset names should be considered
attributes of the dataset being used, and be specified once only for that 
dataset. The Project and Dataset names would then be inherited from the 
dataset by each program in turn.</P>

<P>This has been implemented in CCP4 by adding information on Project and 
Dataset names to the header of the MTZ file. In a merged MTZ file, 
datasets are held as one or more data columns. In addition to the
label and type attributes, each column now has an extra attribute specifying
to which dataset it belongs. A list of all datasets included in the file, 
with the corresponding Project and Dataset names, is held separately in
the MTZ header.</P> 

<P>Since CCP4 release 5.0, datasets are grouped according to the crystal
they were obtained from. The MTZ header now holds various information about 
the crystals and the datasets represented in the file, see the 
<A HREF="mtzformat.html">MTZ format</a> document. This structure continues
to support the Project Name / Dataset Name for harvesting, but is also
used in a wider context.</P>

<P>The code changes necessary to manipulate this information were included
in CCP4 release 3.5. Ideally, dataset information should be added to the
MTZ file at the beginning, <EM>e.g.</EM> in MOSFLM, but this information can be added
at any time, most conveniently with the program <A HREF="cad.html">CAD</A>. 
Once the information is in the MTZ file, it can be checked by running 
<A HREF="mtzdump.html"><tt>mtzdmp</tt></A> which
shows all the MTZ header information (go on, try it!), including the 
list of datasets:
<pre><A NAME="list_of_datasets"></A>
 
 * Number of Datasets =   4
 
 * Dataset ID, project/crystal/dataset names, cell dimensions, wavelength:

             64.8970   78.3230   38.7920   90.0000   90.0000   90.0000

and the datasets which each column corresponds to:
<pre>
 
 * Column Labels :

 H K L FNAT SIGFNAT FreeR_flag FHG2 SDFHG2 FHG2DEL SDFHG2DEL FPTNCD25 SIGFPTNCD25 
DELFPTNCD25 SIGDELFPTNCD25 FIOD25 SIGFIOD25 DELFIOD25 SIGDELFIOD25

 * Column Types :

 H H H F Q I F Q D Q F Q D Q F Q D Q

 * Associated datasets :

 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 4
 
</pre>

<P>In CCP4, columns to be used are selected from the MTZ file by the
LABIN keyword; for example, the command
<pre>
LABIN FP=FIOD25 SIGFP=SIGFIOD25
</pre>
tells the program to use the 15th and 16th columns. In addition, the program
now also knows that these columns are from the 4th dataset, with Project Name
RNASE and Dataset Name DERIV_I.</P>

<P>Unmerged or multi-record MTZ files are treated slightly differently. 
In this case, a particular column may correspond to several datasets,
distinguished by different batch numbers. Datasets are therefore attached
to batches rather than columns, and a pointer to the relevant dataset
is held in the batch header.</P>

<P>As an aside, classifying MTZ columns according to dataset has other uses.
Previously, it was assumed that columns existed as independent entities,
but this is clearly not the case, for example F(+) and F(-) columns, or
F and sigmaF columns. Some programs now use dataset information to check
for certain dependencies, for example the program <A HREF="reindex.html">REINDEX</A> 
may need to
swap F(+) and F(-) columns and therefore needs to identify which F(+)
column goes with which F(-) column.</P>

<H2><A NAME="assigning"></A><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Assigning datasets</FONT></H2>

Dataset names should be assigned when an MTZ file is first created, e.g. in
the programs <a href="mosflm.html">MOSFLM</a>, <A HREF="combat.html">COMBAT</A>, 
<A HREF="scalepack2mtz.html">SCALEPACK2MTZ</A>, <A HREF="f2mtz.html">F2MTZ</A> and <a href="dtrek2mtz.html">DTREK2MTZ</a>. 
This is done with the keywords PNAME and DNAME, or with the more general NAME
keyword; otherwise simple defaults are
chosen by the program. These names can be changed at any time using the 
program <A HREF="cad.html">CAD</A> for merged MTZ files or <A HREF="rebatch.html">
REBATCH</A> for unmerged MTZ files, or by any of the harvesting programs.

<H2><A NAME="harvesting_from_CCP4"></A><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Harvesting from CCP4 programs</FONT></H2>

<P>From CCP4 release 4.0, dataset information will be used to write out
deposition files. The CCP4 programs affected are 
<A HREF="scala.html">SCALA</A>, <A HREF="truncate.html">TRUNCATE</A>, 
<A HREF="mlphare.html">MLPHARE</A>, <A HREF="refmac5.html">REFMAC</A> and 
<A HREF="restrain.html">RESTRAIN</A>. Provided a Project Name
and a Dataset Name are specified (either explicitly or from the MTZ file)
and provided the NOHARVEST keyword is <EM>not</EM> given, these programs will
automatically produce a deposition file. This file will be written to
<P><quote>
<tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt>/<tt>DepositFiles</tt>/<i>&lt;projectname&gt;</i>/
<i>&lt;datasetname&gt;.&lt;programname&gt;</i>
</quote></P>
<P>The environment variable <tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt> defaults to the user's
home directory, but could be changed, for example, to a group project
directory.</P>

<P>At the end of a project, the entire contents of the directory
<tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt>/<tt>DepositFiles</tt>/<i>&lt;projectname&gt;</i>
can be sent to the deposition centre for processing. Note that, because
of the file-naming scheme, only the last run of a particular program
with a particular dataset will be preserved, and it is the user's responsibility
to ensure that this is the authoritative version. The <A HREF="#usecwd" TARGET="_self">USECWD</A> keyword can
be used to send deposit files from speculative runs to the local directory
rather than the official project directory. This keyword can also be used 
when the program is being run on a machine without access to the directory
<tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt>, in which case the user must transfer the deposition
file afterwards.</P>

<P>In summary, the extra keywords associated with harvesting that will be
included in most programs are:
<dl>
<dt><A NAME="pname"></A>PNAME
<dd>Project Name. In most cases, this will be inherited from the MTZ file.
<dt><A NAME="dname"></A>DNAME
<dd>Dataset Name. In most cases, this will be inherited from the MTZ file.
<dt><A NAME="private"></A>PRIVATE
<dd>Set the directory permissions to '700', <EM>i.e.</EM> read/write/execute for
the user only (otherwise '755').
<dt><A NAME="usecwd"></A>USECWD
<dd>Write the deposit file to the current directory, rather than a
subdirectory of $HARVESTHOME
<dt><A NAME="rsize"></A>RSIZE
<dd>Maximum width of a row in the deposit file (default 80).
<dt>NOHARVEST
<dd>Do not write out a deposit file; default is to do so provided Project
and Dataset names are available.
</dl>
There will inevitably have to be cooperation between members of a group
working on the same project to ensure that all relevant deposition files
are gathered together in the same directory, but such cooperation should
occur anyway. At the time of deposition, there should be a resultant
saving of time, as well increased reliability in the information submitted.</P>

<H2><A NAME="deposition_files"></A><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Deposition files</FONT></H2>

<P>Deposition files are written in 
<a href="http://www.iucr.ac.uk/iucr-top/cif/mmcif/ndb/index.html" TARGET="_EXTERNAL">mmCIF</a>
format. The possible contents of an mmCIF file are described in a continually-evolving 
<a href="http://www.iucr.ac.uk/iucr-top/cif/mmcif/ndb/dictionary/dict-html/cif_mm.dic/Index/index.html" TARGET="_EXTERNAL">dictionary</a> 
of allowed data items. Harvesting requires
additional data items to those in the current standard dictionary, and
an extended dictionary is distributed by CCP4 as
<tt>$CLIBD/cif_mm.dic</tt></P>

<H2><A NAME="example"></A><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Example of deposition files</FONT></H2>

<P>The distributed TOXD example dataset contains 4 datasets, all assigned
to the Project Name &quot;TOXD&quot;, and having the Dataset Names &quot;NATIVE&quot;, &quot;DERIV_AU&quot;,
&quot;DERIV_MM&quot; and &quot;DERIV_I&quot; (see <A HREF="#list_of_datasets">above</A>). Running <tt>mlphare</tt> to phase the native
dataset produces a file <tt>$HARVESTHOME/DepositFiles/TOXD/NATIVE.mlphare</tt>. This file starts
with information on when and how the file was created:

The deposit files should be easily readable, but they should not be
altered - they represent an authentic record of the structure solution 
process.</P>

<H2><A NAME="implementation_in_ccp4i"></A><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Implementation in CCP4I</FONT></H2>

<P>Details on the implementation of data harvesting in CCP4I (mainly for
programmers only) can be found
<A HREF="../ccp4i/help/programmers/harvest.html" TARGET="_PROGRAMMERSDOCS">elsewhere</A>.</P>


<H2><FONT COLOR="#CC3333">Deposition</FONT></H2>
<P>The process of deposition involves sending a collection of files containing all the information about the structure of the molecule, and how it was solved, to a deposition centre. The deposition centre will then run a series of programs to check the validity of the structure before accepting it into the PDB. There are three main deposition sites:
<p>1.   <a href="http://autodep.ebi.ac.uk">European Bioinformatics Institute, UK</a>
<br>2.   <a href="http://pdb.rutgers.edu/adit">Rutgers, USA</a>
<br>3.   <a href="http://pdbdep.protein.osaka-u.ac.jp/adit">Osaka, Japan</a>

<p>The current version of <a href="http://autodep.ebi.ac.uk/">Autodep, version 3.1,</a> supports the upload of CCP4 Harvest files. Autodep recommends the following information be available when depositing a structure:
<pre>      Harvest Files from CCP4 or CNS
      PDB file of atomic coordinates
      Sequence reference
      Description of heterogens
      Manuscript describing structure
      Data collection results, unit cell and structure refinement statistics
</pre>

<p>For information regarding the deposition of Structure Factors into the Protein Data Bank, <a href="http://autodep.ebi.ac.uk/sf.html">click here.</a>

<p>The current version of <a href="http://pdb.rutgers.edu/adit/">ADIT! (AutoDep Input Tool)</a> involves 3 steps: a data format check, which checks the file format of the PDB model and CIF structure factor files; a validation precheck, which creates a validation report for the structure, and finally the deposition of the structure into the database. ADIT requires the same information as the AutoDep tool.
