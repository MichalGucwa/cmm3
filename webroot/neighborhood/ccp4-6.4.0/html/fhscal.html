<H2>NAME</H2>
<B>fhscal </B>
- Scaling of isomorphous derivative data using Kraut's method.

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P><B>fhscal hklin</B> <I>foo_in.mtz </I><B>hklout</B> <I>foo_out.mtz</I>
<BR>
[<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>] </P>

<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>Derivative to native scale factors are calculated in equi-volume shells
in reciprocal space using Kraut's formula (ref 1), generalised to use both
centric and acentric data, and applied to the derivative data. This formula
takes account of the degree of heavy-atom substitution, but does not require
the presence of anomalous differences. </P>

<P>The program also computes a scale factor to put the isomorphous
difference Patterson on the correct scale for the vector-space
refinement program <a href="vecref.html">VECREF</a>. </P>

<P>It also possible to apply the scales to all "scaleable"
columns in a dataset (i.e. to F+/- and to the structure intensities; see the
<a href="#labin">LABIN</a> keyword), and this is advisable to avoid mixtures
of scaled and unscaled data for a single derivative. For input MTZ files with
dataset information, FHSCAL will attempt to check and warn you accordingly
if it detects datasets which will be output with such a mixture. In these
cases, specifying the <a href="#auto">AUTO</a> keyword will cause the
appropriate scale factor to be applied automatically to all such columns.</P>

<H2><A NAME="keywords"></A>INPUT CONTROL DATA</H2>

<P>Free format using keywords. The following keywords may be used; only
the leading 4 characters are significant and the order is immaterial: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="#auto"><B>AUTO</B></A>
<A HREF="#bias"><B>BIAS</B></A>,
<A HREF="#cent"><B>CENT</B></A>,
<A HREF="#end"><B>END</B></A>,
<A HREF="#labin"><B>LABIN</B></A>,
<A HREF="#list"><B>LIST</B></A>,
<A HREF="#resolution"><B>RESO</B></A>,
<A HREF="#shells"><B>SHELLS</B></A>,
<A HREF="#title"><B>TITLE</B></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The LABIN keyword is always required, the others are optional and assume
default values if omitted. Use of BIAS 1 is recommended, provided the standard
deviations produced by the data processing program (<EM>e.g.</EM> SCALA) are
reliable. If in doubt, omit BIAS. </P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="title"></A>TITLE &lt;title&gt;</DT>

<DD> Title (max 100 characters). </DD>

<DT><A NAME="list"></A>LIST &lt;list&gt;</DT>

<DD> Number of reflections to list (for debugging purposes). Default =
0. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="shells"></A>SHELLS &lt;nshell&gt;</DT>

<DD> Number of shells to divide data (aim to have at least 200 reflections
per shell; the program may override your choice in order to maintain this 
limit). If there is more than one derivative to be scaled, this applies
to the one with the highest resolution. Default = 20. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="bias"></A>BIAS &lt;bias&gt;</DT>

<DD> Bias factor to multiply standard deviations. This is used to correct
for the bias effect when averaging squares of differences. Normally this
should be 1, however care should be taken that the standard deviations
are valid; for example, some programs set the s.d. of a zero F to 9999;
the correct value is sqrt(I+sigma(I))-sqrt(I). This will cause the program
to give incorrect results; either ignore the s.d.'s by setting BIAS = 0,
or better delete or correct the reflection(s). Default = 0. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="resolution"></A>RESOLUTION &lt;maxres&gt; [ &lt;minres&gt;
]</DT>

<DD> Maxres and minres can be given in any order and in Angstrom units
or as 4*sin(theta)**2/lamda**2. If specified then reflections outside this
resolution range will be excluded from scaling and the output MTZ file.
If the card is absent then all possible reflections are used for scaling
and the resolution range of the native determines the output. If only one
number is given it will be taken as the high resolution cutoff. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="labin"></A>LABIN &lt;program label&gt;=&lt;file label&gt;</DT>

<DD> MTZ assignments, see <A HREF="#files">below</A>. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="auto"></A>AUTO</DT>

<DD>Switches on AUTOmatic column selection. This option can only be used if
the input file contains dataset information. 

<P>It is only necessary to specify <tt>FPHn</tt> for
each dataset on the <a href="#labin">LABIN</a> line (except in special cases,
see below). Other labels can also be specified if desired. The program will
then try to identify all "scaleable" columns in the dataset, automatically
read them in and then apply the appropriate scale factor determined from
<tt>FPHn</tt>. </P>

<P>This option is intended to prevent a mixture of scaled and unscaled columns
within a dataset, e.g. <tt>FPHn</tt> is scaled but not <tt>FPHn(+)</tt> and
<tt>FPHn(-)</tt>. There are a couple of caveats:</P>

<OL>
<LI>It is assumed that each dataset contains the information for one derivative.
<LI>There may be problems with the automatic scaling if datasets contain both
    <tt>SIGIMEAN</tt> and <tt>SIGDPHn</tt>. This is because the program cannot
    distinguish between sigmas for intensities (which need to be scaled by the
    square of the scale factor) and those for other quantities (which are
    multiplied by the scale factor).
    <BR> In these cases the automatic selection will make a best guess at
    which sigma is which; the ambiguity can also be resolved provided that
    <tt>IMEAN</tt> and <tt>SIGIMEAN</tt> are explicitly set by the user on
    the <a href="#labin">LABIN</a> line (which is safer).
</OL>
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="cent"></A>CENT</DT>

<DD> Use only centric reflections to compute the scale factors. All reflections
will be scaled and output. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="end"></A>END</DT>

<DD> Terminate input. Equivalent to end-of-file. </DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="files"></A>INPUT and OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<P>Standard MTZ reflection files are used for input (HKLIN) and output
(HKLOUT). The following column labels are used : </P>

<PRE>
        H, K, L         Standard meaning.

        FP, SIGFP       Native amplitude and sigma.

</PRE>

<P>If only 1 derivative is being scaled: </P>

<PRE>
        FPH, SIGFPH     Derivative amplitude and sigma.

        DPH, SIGDPH     Derivative anomalous difference and sigma
                        (optional).

        FPH(+), SIGFPH(+), FPH(-), SIGFPH(-)
                        Derivative amplitudes and sigmas for Friedel pair
                        (optional).

</PRE>

<P>If more than 1 derivative is being scaled (up to 20 per run), the column
labels are FPH1, SIGFPH1, [ DPH1, SIGDPH1, FPH1(+), SIGFPH1(+), FPH1(-), SIGFPH1(-), ]
FPH2, SIGFPH2, [ DPH2 ... ] <EM>etc.</EM></P>

<P>Scales are applied to FPH, SIGFPH and DPH, SIGDPH, FPH(+),
SIGFPH(+), FPH(-), SIGFPH(-) if present. All other columns, including
those for which no label assignments are given, are output
unchanged. </P>

<H2><A NAME="caveat"></A>CAVEAT</H2>

<P>WARNING : Reflections for which there is a derivative measurement but
no native and which have a greater value of S than any reflection for which
both are measured, will be rejected (because no valid scale can be applied).
The rejections must be re-incorporated later when higher resolution native
data becomes available. </P>

<P>In order to avoid losing reflections in the scaling procedure, it is worth
considering using the dataset with the highest resolution limit as the reference
(<EM>i.e.</EM> 'native') dataset in FHSCAL.</P>

<H2><A NAME="output"></A>PRINTER OUTPUT</H2>

<P>After echoing the input data, a table with the following columns is
produced for each derivative: </P>

<ol>
<li> Shell number
<li> Maximum resolution for shell
<li> Number of reflections in shell
<li> RMS FP
<li> RMS FPH
<li> RMS (K.FPH - FP) for centrics
<li> RMS (K.FPH - FP) for acentrics
<li> Smoothed scale factor for shell
</ol>

<P>Overall scale and temperature factors are determined from a Wilson plot
and printed with their estimated standard deviations; however the scale
factors actually applied to the derivative data are obtained by interpolating
the shell scale factors. </P>

<P>At the end, the V factor (pseudo-cell volume) for the FFT program for
use in computing a correctly scaled isomorphous difference Patterson is
given:

<dl>
<dd>    V'  =  V * C / Kv
</dl>

where V is the true cell volume, C is the completeness of the data and
the scale factor Kv is defined <A HREF="#scale_factor_kv">below</A>. 
This value should be used for the 
<a href="fft.html#vf000">VF000 keyword of FFT</a> when preparing
a Patterson map for the program <a href="vecref.html">VECREF</a>.</P>

<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<P>In addition to the usual MTZ file opening errors: </P>

<P>ERROR(S) IN DATA: syntax errors were found in the general equivalent
positions. Check for spurious characters, missing commas, extra commas
etc. </P>

<P>ERROR - NO REFLECTIONS: no common reflections were found. Check column
assignments, check reflection listing. </P>

<P>NO REFLECTIONS IN SHELL n. Try using smaller number of shells. Reflections
may be missing in a resolution range. </P>

<H2><A NAME="function"></A>PROGRAM FUNCTION</H2>

<P>Kraut's formula can be derived by equating the Patterson origins </P>

<PRE>
        K^2 . sum FPH^2  =  sum FP^2  +  sum FH^2               (1)

</PRE>

<P>where FPH, FP and FH are derivative, native and heavy-atom amplitudes
respectively, and K is the derivative scale to be determined. </P>

<P>For acentric reflections : </P>

<PRE>
        &lt;FH^2&gt;a  ~=  2.&lt;(K.FPH - FP)^2&gt;                         (2)

</PRE>

<P>Elimination of the unknown FH from (1) and (2) gives a quadratic equation
for K, the solution of which is : </P>

<PRE>
        K  =  (2.sum FP.FPH  -  sqrt(4.(sum FP.FPH)^2 -
              3.sum FP^2 . sum FPH^2)) / sum FPH^2              (3)

</PRE>

<P>Note that in the original reference the leading factor given as 1/2
should be 2. This formula is valid only for acentric reflections. However
it can easily be generalised to include centrics by noting that </P>

<PRE>
        &lt;FH^2&gt;  ~=  &lt;M.(K.FPH - FP)^2&gt;                          (4)

</PRE>

<P>where M = 1 for centric and 2 for acentric, so using (4) instead of
(2) : </P>

<PRE>
        K  =  (sum M.FP.FPH  -  sqrt((sum M.FP.FPH)^2 -
              sum (M+1).FP^2 . sum (M-1).FPH^2)) / sum (M-1).FPH^2
                                                                (5)

</PRE>

<P>The numerator and denominator of (5) could be zero if all reflections
in a shell were centric; this is unlikely, but just in case the equivalent
formula can be used instead : </P>

<PRE>
        K  =  sum (M+1).FP^2 / (sum M.FP.FPH  +
              sqrt((sum M.FP.FPH)^2 - sum (M+1).FP^2 . sum (M-1).FPH^2))
                                                                (6)

</PRE>

<P>This formula is modified slightly to take into account the bias effect
when averaging the squares of differences, <EM>i.e.</EM> the term &lt;M.(K.FPH - FP)^2&gt;
is replaced by : &lt;M.(K.FPH - FP)^2 - M.((K.sigma(FPH))^2+sigma(FP)^2)&gt;
where the sigma's have been multiplied by the BIAS factor. </P>

<P>The program reads the input control data, then makes a first pass through
the reflections to get the resolution limits (can be controlled by RESO
card), then a second pass to flag reflections as centric or acentric and
accumulate the sums in shells for the scale factors. The scale factors
are calculated and smoothed, and applied in a third pass. The program also
computes a scale factor to apply to the isomorphous difference Patterson
for use in the program VECREF: </P>
