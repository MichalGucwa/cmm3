<H1>PATCH_CCP4 (CCP4: Basic)</H1>
<H2>NAME</H2>
<B>patch_ccp4.sh </B>
- automatically patch CCP4 source code files

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P><B>patch_ccp4.sh</B>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>PATCH_CCP4 is a shell script will which will attempt to automatically
download and apply all the available source code patches for the current
release.<P>

<p>Note that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The script doesn't have to be run in any special location as
    it uses the CCP4 environment variables to correctly locate the
    files that are to be updated.</li>
<li>If you have a binary distribution then only data files and scripts
    (such as CCP4i) will be updated.</li>
<li>The script applies the fixes but does not recompile the programs,
    this must still be done by hand - see the relevant section of the
    CCP4 installation documentation.
<li>This will only work for UNIX-like systems.</li>
<li>The user running the patching script needs to have write permission
    on the <tt>$CCP4</tt> directory plus the files that are going to be
    patched.</li>
</ol>

<H2><A NAME="details"></A>DETAILS</H2>

<p>The script operates in the directory <tt>$CCP4/.patches</tt> (which will
be created if it doesn't already exist), and uses the <tt>wget</tt> command
to download the available patches plus an index file from the CCP4 FTP
server.</p>

<p>Each patch (ending with a </tt>.diff</tt> extension) is then checked
to see if it has been applied by previous runs of the script - if not then
an attempt is made to apply it using the <tt>patch</tt> program, and a
record is made of the attempt.</p>
