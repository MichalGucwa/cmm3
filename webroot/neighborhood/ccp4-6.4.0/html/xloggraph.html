<H1> XLOGGRAPH (CCP4: Deprecated Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>xloggraph </b>
- X-windows tool, a viewer of specially formatted `log' files.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>xloggraph</b>
<i>logfilename</i>
<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>
xloggraph belongs to the XCCPJiffy class of simple X11 graphic based
programs.
xloggraph reads specially formatted log file produced by
some of the CCP4 programs, recognises tables and
graphs described in it and produces their graphic
representation.<br>
<i>NB: the <a href="loggraph.html">loggraph</a> program offers an
alternative to xloggraph.</i>
<P> 
xloggraph uses an X-window device and has an option to create a PostScript file.
<P> 
Running the program xloggraph creates a Header window with boxes showing:
<dl>
<dt> Quit<dd>
to exit the program
<dt> (unnamed)<dd>
box containing current log file name
<dt> Show Table List<dd>
Clicking here returns to complete list of Tables
in the file. This box is sensitive only if the
index to Graphs is displayed.
<dt> View File<dd>
Allows one to scroll through the log file
(Try CTRL/S when the pointer is in text window)
<dt> Select from Tables<dd>
<dt> Select from Graphs<dd>
A list of the Tables/Graphs stored within the
log file. Clicking on the particular Table name
will create an index of the Graphs available
from that particular table
Clicking on the particular Graph name will
generate a Graph in an X-window.
<dt><dd>
Quit - in that window closes the window
<dt><dd>
Plot - creates a PostScript version.  (If you want a file go to the
Control Panel first.)
<dt> Control Panel<dd>
Clicking Left Mouse button here
allows one to Toggle between 
Portrait
and  Landscape
for the output Postscript file conversion
and the option to specify a Output File for
the Postscript file. The print command is controlled
by the XCCPJiffy*psPlotCommand resource.
The Quit button exits the control panel.

<H2> REMARK FOR APPLICATION PROGRAMMERS</H2>
<P>
The sections on the syntax for graphs, text, keytext and summaries
can be found in a separate document on the
<a href="loggraphformat.html">loggraph format</a>.</p>
<H2> NOTE ON COLOURS AND LINE STYLES - For Users and Programmers</H2>
xloggraph works in pen graphic mode, each object is painted by a
different virtual pen. By definition, xloggraph uses pen1 for
Graph axes and texts, pen2 for 1st graph, pen3 for the second
etc. Currently 10 pens are available.
<P> 
Colour, Line width and Postscript properties of virtual pens are
controlled via the entries in X-resource database (see X manual). It
is recommended to load X-resources into the X-server database (xrdb).
Once the database is loaded, one can optimise it using xrdb to
load/merge a personalised set of X-Application Resources.
<P> 
X pen is controlled by:
<pre>

XCCPJiffy.graph*draw2d.background:              white
XCCPJiffy.graph*draw2d.pen1Color:               black
XCCPJiffy.graph*draw2d.pen1LineWidth:           1
   .
   .
   .
XCCPJiffy.graph*draw2d.pen10Color:              indigo
XCCPJiffy.graph*draw2d.pen10LineWidth:          1

</pre>
<P> 
Postscript pen by:
<pre>

XCCPJiffy*psPen1Attr:   1 setlinejoin 0.5 setlinewidth [] 0 setdash
   .
   .
   .
XCCPJiffy*psPen10Attr:  1 setlinejoin 0.9 setlinewidth [8 2] 0 setdash

</pre>
To check your current setting use for instance
