<H1> SUPERPOSE (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>

<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>superpose </b>
- structural alignment based on secondary structure matching

<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>superpose</b> <i>foo_1st.pdb</i> [-s CID1] <i>foo_2nd.pdb</i> [-s CID2] 
[ <i>foo_out.pdb</i> ]
<p>
where [-s CID1/2] are optional selection strings in
<a href="pdbcur.html#atom_selection">MMDB convention</a>, and [foo_out.pdb] is 
an optional output file.

<H2><a name="description"> DESCRIPTION</a></H2>

<p><tt>superpose</tt> aligns two structures by matching graphs built on the 
protein's secondary-structure elements, followed by an iterative 
three-dimensional alignment of protein backbone C-alpha atoms.</p>

<p>For this method to work, structures should always include at least three
secondary structural elements.</p>

<H2> INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<H3>foo_1st.pdb</H3>
First input coordinate file. Although typically a PDB file, it can also be
in mmCIF or MMDB binary formats. The input format is detected automatically.
This is considered the Query structure to which the transformation matrix
will be applied.

<H3>foo_2nd.pdb</H3>
Second input coordinate file. Although typically a PDB file, it can also be
in mmCIF or MMDB binary formats. The input format is detected automatically.
This is considered the Target structure.

<h3>foo_out.pdb</h3>
If specified, the result of applying the transformation matrix
to <tt>foo_1st.pdb</tt> is written to <tt>foo_out.pdb</tt>.

<h2>Command line options</h2>

The optional selection strings <tt>[-s CID1/2]</tt> are in the
format described in the <a href="pdbcur.html#atom_selection">pdbcur</a>
documentation. For example, <tt>-s A/23-55</tt> means use only 
residues 23 to 55 of chain A in calculating the alignment.

<H2> PROGRAM OUTPUT</H2>

The program reports the Transformation Matrix calculated for
superimposing <tt>foo_1st.pdb</tt> onto <tt>foo_2nd.pdb</tt>
and the RMSD from the superposition.
<p>
The program then gives a residue-by-residue listing of the
alignment. Strands and helices in the two structures are identified.
The quality of the match for each residue is given.
