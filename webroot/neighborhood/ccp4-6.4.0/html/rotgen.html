<H1> ROTGEN (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>rotgen </b>
- simulate X-ray diffraction rotation images.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>rotgen</b>

<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
ROTGEN is an X-windows based program for carrying out simulations of X-ray diffraction rotation images and analysing the unique data coverage for one or more
crystal settings and series of rotations. A strategy option provides the user with information on the most efficient way to collect data based on the current crystal
setting. Previously processed data stored in an MTZ reflection data file may be included in the analyses if required.
