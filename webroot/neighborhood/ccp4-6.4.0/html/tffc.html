<H2><A NAME="description"></A> DESCRIPTION</H2>
TFFC is a full-symmetry Translation Function program based on the
Harada, Lifchitz, Berthou and Jolles formulation of the Crowther and
Blow T2 function, and it can also be used to calculate the TO/O
function of Harada et al.  TFFC uses structure factor information
(amplitudes and phases) from all molecules in the unit cell whose
positions have already been determined by previous runs of the
program, or are about to be determined in the current run, and not
merely pairs of molecules, as does the C & B T1 function. 
<P> 
Amplitude-only information from all molecules of known orientation
in the unit cell, including any not related by crystallographic
symmetry (whose positions are consequently unknown), is however used in
the Fobs/Fcalc scaling, in the calculation of normalised structure
factor amplitudes, and optionally in the subtraction of the
transform of the intramolecular vector set. 
<P> 
The conventional crystallographic T2 function is in general the
3-dimensional sum function of the pairwise 2-dimensional T1
functions; however in polar space groups the crystallographic T2
function is also 2-dimensional.  It is especially advantageous in
high-symmetry space groups, where the smaller signal/noise ratio
of the peaks in the T1 functions may cause difficulties.
<P> 
TFFC works for all space-group symmetries containing only rotation
and screw axes, and non-primitive lattice elements, provided the
conventional settings in International Tables Vol. A are used (R3
must be indexed on hexagonal axes).
<P> 
The partial T2 function (also called non-crystallographic,
meaning obtained using structure factors from a partially known
structure, which may or may not be related by non-crystallographic
symmetry to the remaining unknown part) is also the 3-dimensional
sum function of the pairwise partial T1 functions; however the
partial T1 and T2 functions are always 3-dimensional.  The program
can also be used to calculate the individual T1 functions, but a
satisfactory automatic method for analysing these functions has yet
to be devised, and so they have to be analysed manually (hopefully
this should never be necessary!).
<P> 
The T2 Translation Function can be used to resolve a space group
ambiguity, for example, I222/I212121 or P3121/P3221, where the
systematic absence conditions do not distinguish the pairs, or for
example P21212/P212121 where the identification of systematic
absences is not always clear-cut. 
<P> 
Three important features which further improve the signal/noise ratio of
the T2 function are the shell-scaling of the F(obs) and F(calc) values
by the difference Wilson method, the use of normalised amplitudes (E
values), and the subtraction of the transform of the intramolecular
vector set from the transform of the Patterson function of the target
structure.
<P> 
The program works by calculating the Fourier coefficients of the
Translation Function from the transform of the intermolecular vector
set, and the Fast Fourier Transform (<A HREF="fft.html">FFT</A>) program is used to effect the
transformation into real space.  This method is about 3 orders of
magnitude faster than a real space search, and the speed is also
much less dependent on the fineness of the grid search. 
<H2><A NAME="requirements"></A> PRE- AND POST-PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS</H2>
It is assumed that the Rotation Function (<EM>e.g.</EM> program <A HREF="#amore.html">AMORE</A>) has been
used to get an accurate orientation (within 2.5 deg at 3 Angstrom
resolution) of the model structure (preferably with thermal parameters)
to the maximum resolution of the data available.  All structure factors
to this resolution for one asymmetric unit in space group P1 in the cell
of the target structure are required (program <A HREF="sfall.html">SFALL</A>).  Then the
calculated structure factors are combined with the observed amplitudes
(program <A HREF="cad.html">CAD</A>); for each hkl there will be one Fobs with sigma(Fobs)
and a number (equal to the number of asymmetric units in the primitive
unit cell of the unknown structure) of Fcalc values with PHIcalc.
<P> 
IMPORTANT:  The unit cell specified in <A HREF="sfall.html">SFALL</A> must be the experimentally
determined cell of the crystal whose structure is being determined, not
some arbitrarily chosen cell as in the Rotation Function.  This is
because the aim is to match the inter-molecular vectors (not the
intra-molecular ones).  This is clearly not possible if the cells of
the unknown and model structures are different. 
<P> 
If there is more than one molecule per asymmetric unit then the above
procedure must be repeated for each molecule, using column labels of
the form FCA1 PCA1 FCA2 PCA2 ... for the first molecule, FCB1 PCB1
FCB2 PCB2 ... for the second and so on.  The files must then be
column-merged into a single input reflection file (using <A HREF="cad.html">CAD</A> this 
operation can be done in a single run).
<P> 
The output of TFFC is used as input to the P1 version of <A HREF="fft.html">FFT</A>.  The
program outputs two sets of Fourier coefficients; for the TO/O function
two FFTs are necessary, using labels A and B for the TO function and AO
and BO for the O function.  It is not necessary to print any maps;
instead specify binary map output in FFT and use the program <A HREF="mapsig.html">MAPSIG</A> to
perform the division TO/O and analyse the results.  For the T2 function
only the labels A and B are used, only one FFT is done, but MAPSIG can
still be used.
<P> 
When computing the TO and O functions, the F000 terms must be entered
manually into the FFT program; the required values are given at the end
of the TFFC printer output (the two values are for the TO and O
functions respectively).  The volume V must also be given, but this
acts only as an arbitrary scale, and any value (typically around 1000)
which gives sensible magnitudes in the Translation Function map can be
used.
<P> 
Note that the reflection indices produced by TFFC are not the same
as those read from the input reflection file.  Consequently the S 
values calculated for these reflections are meaningless, and
therefore it is important not to apply any resolution cutoffs in FFT.  
If resolution cutoffs are desired they must be applied by TFFC to
the original indices. 
<H2><A NAME="keywords"></A> KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>
Data are introduced by the following keywords:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="#find"><B>FIND</B></A>,

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> 
Only the first 4 characters of each keyword are significant.  All keywords
are optional, though normally one would specify LABIN to use other than the
default file labels.
<P> 
The keywords <A HREF="#spacegroup">SPACEGROUP</A> and <A HREF="#symmetry">SYMMETRY</A> are mutually exclusive; one or the
other is only required if the space group information in the reflection
file header is incorrect.  This may happen because the systematic absences
do not unambiguously define the space group; the point group information
defined by the rotation components of the symmetry matrices however must be
correct.  It is not then necessary to re-run SFALL &amp; CAD, it is only
necessary to specify the correct symmetry with either SPACEGROUP or
SYMMETRY.
<H2> VERY IMPORTANT</H2>
The <A HREF="#spacegroup">SPACEGROUP</A> option can only be used if:
<OL>
<LI>Phase shifts due to any screw-axis translations have not already been applied, and</LI>
<LI>The primitive General Equivalent Positions in symop.lib are in exactly the same order as
those used when the input reflection file was prepared.</LI>
</OL>
<P> 
If the space group has screw-axis translations (ignoring non-primitive
lattice translations), and an earlier program used the translation
components to apply phase shifts, the SPACEGROUP option cannot be
used.  The SYMMETRY option must be used and the screw-axis
translations then omitted. 
<P> 
The SYMMETRY option must also be used if the primitive General Equivalent
Positions in symop.lib are in a different order from those originally
specified.  This can happen either because for some space groups different
editions of International Tables have the equivalent positions in a
different order, or because for some space groups with the same point
group, the order of the rotation components may vary.  When the SYMMETRY
option is used, the order of equivalent positions must be identical with
that used when the input file was prepared.
<P> 
No problems should occur using the SPACEGROUP option if
<OL>
<LI>the current versions of the SFALL and CAD programs have been used, and</LI>
<LI>the current version of symop.lib has been used consistently.</LI>
</OL>
<H2> DESCRIPTION OF KEYWORDS</H2>
<H3><A NAME="title"></A> TITLE [String]</H3>
Title (default is to use reflection file title).
<H3><A NAME="spacegroup"></A> SPACEGROUP [String or Integer]</H3>
Name (as in symop.lib) or number in International Tables.
<H3><A NAME="pointgroup"></A> POINTGROUP [String or Integer]</H3>
Name (optionally beginning with pg).  This must be one of
the following :
<pre>

   1    2  222    3  312  321    4  422    6  622   23  432

The number of primitive g.e.p.'s to follow must be then :

   1    2    4    3    6    6    4    8    6   12   12   24

</pre>
The default is to use the point group implied by the space group.
The space/point group may be 1 (one equivalent position) only if the
PART option is specified.
<H3><A NAME="symmetry"></A> SYMMETRY [String]</H3>
Primitive general equivalent position(s) in same format as
International Tables, with one or more per line, separated
by * and/or repeating keyword where necessary.  In whatever
way the g.e.p.'s are set up (SPACEGROUP or SYMMETRY), they
must exactly correspond in order to those used to generate
the input reflection file.
<H3><A NAME="noncryst"></A> NONCRYST [Integer]</H3>
Number of non-crystallographic subunits per crystallographic
asymmetric unit; must be between 0 and 8 inclusive.  The
default is one molecule per asymmetric unit; this is also
implied by values of 0 or 1.
<H3><A NAME="self"></A> SELF</H3>
Intramolecular vector contributions are included.  This is
required for the TO/O function.  The T2 function is the
default (intramolecular vector set subtracted).
<H3><A NAME="shell"></A> SHELL [Integer]</H3>
Approximate number of reflections per shell to divide data
for scaling (default = 100).  This value will be reset if
the number of shells is more than 200.  The program will
stop with an error message if any shell is empty; the
number of reflections per shell should then be increased.
<H3><A NAME="resolution"></A> RESOLUTION [Real(2)]</H3>
Resolution limits (d-spacings in Angstrom) to be applied
(either way round); the default is  20  0  and these values
are recommended for the initial run.
<H3><A NAME="list"></A> LIST [Integer]</H3>
Number of reflections to list (default = 0).  This is only
useful for debugging.
<H3><A NAME="vector"></A> VECTOR [String] [Real(3)]</H3>
In the case of non-crystallographic symmetry, this is
specified for each subunit (A, B, C ... H) whose fractional
translation vector (Tx, Ty, Tz) has been determined by a
previous run of TFFC, or otherwise.
<H3><A NAME="find"></A> FIND [String]</H3>
In the case of non-crystallographic symmetry, this is
specified for the subunit (A, B, C ... H) whose translation
is to be determined in this run.  There may be only one FIND, but it
may be omitted if all but one subunit translations have been defined
using VECTOR.
<H3><A NAME="part"></A> PART</H3>
This sets up the calculation of the partial (non-crystallographic)
Translation Function (previously done by program TFPART).  The
default is to calculate the crystallographic Translation Function
(previously program TFSGEN). 
<P> 
With this option <A HREF="#noncryst">NONCRYST</A. must be specified, and must be between
2 and 8 inclusive, and there must be at least one <A HREF="#vector">VECTOR</A>.
For example if NONCRYST is given as 4, then 3 runs of the program would
be required:
<pre>

Run 1 :  VECTOR  A  Ax Ay Az
         FIND    B

Run 2 :  VECTOR  A  Ax Ay Az
         VECTOR  B  Bx By Bz
         FIND    C

Run 3 :  VECTOR  A  Ax Ay Az
         VECTOR  B  Bx By Bz
         VECTOR  C  Cx Cy Cz
         FIND    D

</pre>
<P> 
The first translation vector for the A subunit could be determined by the
crystallographic Translation Function, except in P1 where the first
translation vector can be chosen arbitrarily.  Note that the translations
need not be determined in the order shown; it may be easier to start by
fixing one of the other subunits, and then determine the other translations
in a different order.
<P> 
To calculate a T1 function, both the subunit label and the number of the
equivalent position must be specified in VECTOR (of which there may only
be one) and FIND; for example:
<pre>

VECTOR  A1  Ax Ay Az
FIND    B2
</pre>
<H3><A NAME="labin"></A> LABIN [String]</H3>
MTZ column label assignments.
<P> 
If <A HREF="#noncryst">NONCRYST</A> = 0 or omitted, the program labels are:
<pre>

H K L FP SIGFP FC1 PC1 FC2 PC2 ...

where FP, SIGFP = Fobs, sigma(Fobs)
FCn, PCn = Fcalc and phase of n'th asymmetric unit of model.
</pre>
<P> 
If NONCRYST &gt; 0 the program labels are H K L FP SIGFP (Fobs,
sigma(Fobs)), followed by NONCRYST*NUMGEP pairs of columns
containing the partial Fcalc, phase contributions (NUMGEP =
number of primitive g.e.p.'s).
<P> 
For example, if NONCRYST = 4, NUMGEP = 2, the column labels
would be:
<br>
<pre>

       FCA1  PCA1  FCA2  PCA2  FCB1  PCB1  FCB2  PCB2
       FCC1  PCC1  FCC2  PCC2  FCD1  PCD1  FCD2  PCD2

</pre>
<EM>i.e.</EM> the letters A,B,C,D refer to non-crystallographically
related subunits and the numbers 1,2... refer to
crystallographically related subunits.
<H2><A NAME="notes"></A> NOTES</H2>
<H3> The asymmetric unit of the crystallographic Translation Function</H3>
The Translation Function is always computed in space group P1, but
in many cases the crystallographic T function has extra
translational symmetry, due to the presence of equivalent origins in
the space group, which reduces the size of the asymmetric unit which
need be computed.  These alternative origins arise either from
rotational symmetry elements or from non-primitive lattice
translations.  The Translation Function never has rotational
symmetry.  However it should be approximately centrosymmetric about
the solution vector, but since this is unknown, and therefore in a
general position, this information cannot be used to reduce the size
of the asymmetric unit. 
<P> 
In polar space groups, the translation vector for the
crystallographic T function is limited to the plane perpendicular to
the unique axis, so only one section need be calculated; also, all
space groups have equivalent origins, which reduces the asymmetric
unit of the Translation Function, <EM>e.g.</EM> in orthorhombic, these origin
positions are at 0 and 1/2 in x, y and z, which reduces the
asymmetric unit to 0 to 1/2 along each axis.  The table below shows
the asymmetric unit for each point group.

In centred space groups, these asymmetric units may be reduced
further.  Note that although higher symmetry point groups have
smaller asymmetric units (as a fraction of the unit cell) in the
space group, they have larger asymmetric units in the Translation
Function.
<H3> The asymmetric unit of the partial Translation Function</H3>
The partial Translation Function only has translational symmetry
arising from the lattice-centring symmetry elements, so that for all
primitive space groups regardless of the point group symmetry, a
complete unit cell in P1 must be computed.  For centred cells this
can be reduced; for I-centred cells, for example, 1/2 a cell must be
computed. 
<H3> Combining the crystallographic and partial Translation Functions</H3>
If TFFC is used in the presence of non-crystallographic symmetry, it
must be given the partial structure factors of all the subunits of
known orientation, whether the translations of the subunits are
known or not.  The crystallographic and partial Translation Functions
are then calculated separately; of course the partial T function 
cannot be calculated unless at least one translation vector has been 
determined using the crystallographic T function (or in the case of
space group P1, the first vector can be fixed arbitrarily).
<P> 
For a given subunit, the total Translation Function is simply the
sum of crystallographic and partial contributions, and the program
<A HREF="mapsig.html">MAPSIG</A> can be used to do this summation (a minimum function could be
used, but I have not tried this).  In practice I have not found it
necessary to do this summation; manual inspection of the peak lists
generated from the separate maps is usually all that is necessary.

The A and B columns (real and imaginary components of the Fourier
coefficient of the transform of the Translation Function) are used in a
run of FFT in P1.  The solution vector should appear as a single peak;
the corresponding molecule is to be translated by this vector.  The AO
and BO columns are the transform of the Harada et al O (overlap)
function.
<H2><A NAME="program_structure"></A> PROGRAM STRUCTURE</H2>
The TFFC program is a merger of the Translation Function programs 
TFSGEN and TFPART, with the PART option added to select the 
appropriate code.  The program consists of the following routines:
<P> 
TFFC (main subprogram)
<br>
Dimensions a working array (not used when PART option is selected).  Calls
CCPFYP and TFMAIN.
<P> 
BLOCK DATA
<br>
Initialises file titles,flags for Harker section test, sums for scaling.
<P> 
TFMAIN
<br>
Calls GETINP to set up input data, calls GENPGT (for partial T1
function only), reads MTZ file first time for resolution range,
reads MTZ file second time for scale factor sums, putting Fobs^2 and
Fcalc^2 into bins of constant d*^3, calculates maximum indices and
scale factors.  For crystallographic T function dimensions a number
of complex arrays (one for each Harker section) and calls TFSGEN. 
For partial T function calls TFPART. 
<P> 
GETINP
<br>
Calls MTZINI, opens HKLIN reflection file.  Calls PARSER to read
control data and checks it.  Sets up input labels and calls GRASSN to
do input file assignments. 
<P> 
GRASSN
<br>
Makes input MTZ file assignments.
<P> 
GENPGT
<br>
Generates point group multiplication table.
<P> 
MULEPS
<br>
Calculates reflection multiplicity and symmetry weight factor epsilon.
<P> 
GENEQ
<br>
Generates equivalent reflection.
<P> 
TFSGEN
<br>
Reads MTZ file third time, applies scales using spline interpolation
(FSPLIN).  Accumulates translation and overlap Fourier coefficients in
arrays.  This is necessary because the FFT input routines only use the
last coefficients read in for a particular hkl (to avoid having to worry
about reflection multiplicity).  Calls GWOPEN to open output MTZ file 
HKLOUT and writes structure factors using routine PUTREF.
<P> 
FSPLIN
<br>
Cubic spline interpolation.
<P> 
GWOPEN
<br>
General purpose output file (HKLOUT) open for MTZ.
<P> 
PUTREF
<br>
Writes a structure factor to HKLOUT, accumulating minimum, maximum 
and sum statistics for data columns.
<P> 
TFPART
<br>
Calls GWOPEN to open output MTZ file HKLOUT.  Reads MTZ file third
time, applies scales using spline interpolation (FSPLIN). 
Calculates translation and overlap Fourier coefficients and writes
structure factors using routine PUTREF. 
<H2> IMPLEMENTATION</H2>
For large problems it may be necessary to increase the
dimension of the large array A.  If this is required, an appropriate
message will be issued; change the array dimension in the first
PARAMETER statement (NA), then re-compile and re-link.
