<h2>NAME</h2>
<p><b>DIMPLE</b> - automated difference map calculation

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
<!-- copied from of ECM abstract -->
DIMPLE (DIfference Map PipeLinE) an automated software pipeline for rapidly
processing crystals that contain a known protein and possibly a ligand bound
to this protein. The main goal is to present a user with a quick answer to the
question of whether or not they have a bound ligand or drug candidate in their
crystal. The software is developed primarily for use at synchrotron beamlines,
but can be used also for in-house automation.  DIMPLE takes the already known
"apo" structure for the target protein and compares it with the electron
density map for the same, crystallised structure (and possibly bound ligand)
interpreted from the X-ray diffraction images. It then presents the user with
a set of snapshot images illustrating the regions where there are large areas
of electron density unaccounted for by the protein structure model. Within a
few seconds, an experienced user can decipher from these images if any of this
unaccounted for density indicates a bound ligand.  A positive result can mean
that the rest of the batch of crystals for this particular ligand can be
discarded allowing for a more efficient use of the beam time and saving the
user from lots of potentially unnecessary processing.
<p>
It takes in a merged MTZ file containing intensities and a PDB coordinate file
containing the already solved protein structure.  It outputs an MTZ file
containing the calculated electron density map and difference map along with
the positioned structure and images of the density blobs.
