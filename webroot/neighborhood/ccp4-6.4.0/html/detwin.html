<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>Twinned data is measured when two or more copies of the reciprocal lattice
overlap. Hence we need to deconvolute the two twinned components to obtain useable data.
The equations for two overlapping reflections, Itrue(h1) and Itrue(h2), are:
<pre>
     ITw(h1) = (1-tf)*Itrue(h1)  +     tf*Itrue(h2)
     ITw(h2) =     tf*Itrue(h1)  + (1-tf)*Itrue(h2)

     where tf is the twin fraction, often denoted as '<A HREF="#twin_fraction">alpha</A>'


     thus Itrue(h1) = ((1-tf)*iTw(h1) -tf*iTw(h2)) / (1-2tf)
     thus Itrue(h2) = ((1-tf)*iTw(h2) -tf*iTw(h1)) / (1-2tf)
     also
     var(h1) = ((1-tf)/(1-2tf))**2 * sdTw(h1)**2 + (tf/(1-2tf))**2 * sdTw(h2)**2
     var(h2) = ((1-tf)/(1-2tf))**2 * sdTw(h2)**2 + (tf/(1-2tf))**2 * sdTw(h1)**2
</pre>
<P>This deconvolution is only possible if <TT>tf</TT> is not exactly 0.5.
As it approaches this value the variances become extremely large.</P>

<P>The occurrence of twinning can often be recognised from the intensity statistics of
the data set. 
It is important to first check whether the crystal has a pseudo translation
relating two or more molecules in the asymmetric unit. Such a translation will 
result in some reflection classes being very weak.
This program carries out several tests for twinning as a function of
both twinning fraction, and resolution. 
It reads  either intensities or amplitudes from an MTZ file,
It can also detwin merohedrally twinned data for a given twinning fraction and 
write either corrected intensities or amplitudes for a given twinning fraction.
<p>
The twin operator is required (see <A HREF="twinning.html#lookup_tables">
TABLE OF POSSIBILITIES</A>),
and for MTZ output, the chosen twin fraction. The CCP4 GUI suggests possible twinning 
operators derived from the space group, or it can be entered by the user.
<p>
The <STRONG>twinning tests</STRONG> performed are:
<p>The partial twin test (see <A HREF="#reference4">reference [4]</A>)  &lt;H&gt; = &lt;|Itw1 -Itw2|/(Itw1 +Itw2)&gt;
plotted against theoretical expectations. 

<p>The estimate of the twinning factor as (0.5 -&lt;H&gt;), plotted against resolution.

<p>Those tabulated against the twinning factor, for values ranging from 0.00 to 0.48, are<BR>
(<EM>N.B.</EM> it is impossible to evaluate <TT>Itrue</TT> if the twinning-factor is exactly 0.5):
<ol type=a>
  <li>Number of negative intensities after detwinning  (Britton plot)
   This is plotted for all data, and for the subset where Itw is greater than 3 Sigma.
   <br>
   If the twinning fraction is too small there should be no negative 
   intensities generated; if it is too large, the number will increase linearly.
   Fitting a straight line through the plot gives a good estimate of the
   twinning fraction.
   <p>
 <li>The second moment of Z (which is also the fourth moment of E) as a function
   of resolution and twinning fraction. Here, Z is defined as I' / &lt;I'&gt; 
   where I' = I / epsilon, and epsilon is the symmetry factor. For untwinned acentric 
   data this should equal 2, and for a perfect twin it should be 1.5.
   <p>
 <li>The correlation between I1 and I2 before and after detwinning.
   The overall correlation is dominated by the low resolution data and
   is therefore not very sensitive, and can be misleading.  However for high 
   resolution data it should drop to 0.00 UNLESS there is an NCS operator 
   related to the twinning operator.
</ol>
<p>
If the output MTZ file contains IMEAN, it can be run through 
<A HREF="truncate.html">TRUNCATE</A> again, and the
other moments and the N(z) test examined to see if the intensity statistics 
now follow the expected distribution for non-twinned data.
twinned. See <A HREF="twinning.html#examples">Cumulative distribution plot</A>, 
which for twinned data becomes sigmoidal, and the moments of E (or Z) which are 
different for twinned data than for untwinned.</p>
<p>
The general formulae for expected moments &lt;Z^k&gt; for untwinned
acentric data are (Z defined above):
<pre>

  k-th moment of Z = Gamma(k+1)  = k!                    if k is an integer
  k-th moment of Z = sqrt(PI) * k * (k-1) * ... * 0.5    if k equals integer+0.5

  k-th moment of E = (k/2)-th moment of Z

<H2> <A NAME="files"></A>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
The following input and output files are used by the program:
<P> 
Input Files:
<dl>
<dt> HKLIN  <dd>
Input MTZ file. <br>
This would normally be the output of <a href="scala.html">SCALA</a>
or <a href="scalepack2mtz.html">SCALEPACK2MTZ</a> containing the
measured intensities, but structure factor amplitudes can also be used
as input. See the <A HREF="#labin">LABIN</A> keyword for details.
</dl>
<P> 
Output Files:
<dl>
<dt> HKLOUT  <dd>
Output MTZ file. <br>
A file containing corrected Is or Fs for a single twin fraction,
which must be specified with the <A HREF="#twin_fraction">TWIN_FRACTION</A>
keyword. If the file contains IMEAN, it can be run through 
<A HREF="truncate.html">TRUNCATE</A>, which tests whether the data has
been successfully detwinned. If no TWIN_FRACTION keyword is given, then no
output file is written.
The column labels will be extended to include the string"_detw".
</dl>

<H2><A NAME="keywords"></A>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>

The various data control lines are identified by keywords. Only the
first 4 letters of each keyword are necessary. The possible keywords are:
<blockquote>
<A HREF="#debug">DEBUG</A>,  <A HREF="#plot">PLOT</A>,<A HREF="#labin">LABIN</A>,
<A HREF="#resolution">RESOLUTION</A>, <A HREF="#operator">OPERATOR</A>,
<A HREF="#sigmacut">SIGMACUT</A>,<A HREF="#title">TITLE</A>, <A HREF="#twin_fraction">TWIN_FRACTION</A>
</blockquote>
<p>
<H3><A NAME="title"></A>  TITLE &lt;title&gt; </h3> [OPTIONAL INPUT]
<p>
Title to write to output reflection file.
<p>
Default is to keep the title on the input MTZ file. If there is no
title on the input MTZ file, then the title is set to:
&quot;From Detwin on the &lt;date&gt;&quot;

<H3><A NAME="sigmacut"></A>SIGMACUT &lt;Nsig&gt;</H3>

<P>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</P>

<P>The various tests are carried out with all reflections, and repeated for those
reflections which are greater than &lt;Nsig&gt;*I. Tests such as the Britton plot or
those using &lt;H&gt; are unreliable for weak data.</P>

<H3><A NAME="resolution"></A>RESOLUTION &lt;Dmin&gt; &lt;Dmax&gt;</H3>

<P>[OPTIONAL INPUT] </P>

<P>Resolution limits - either 4(sin theta/lambda)**2 or d in Angstroms
(either order). Reflections outside these limits will be excluded from
all analysis and omitted on output. Defaults are taken from the range of
data in the input file (i.e. all data included). </P>

<H3><A NAME="operator"></A>OPERATOR &lt;string&gt; </h3> 
<p>
Twinning operator, given as the indices of the reflection that is
related to the reflection (h,k,l) by the twin operator. 
See <A HREF="twinning.html#lookup_tables">TABLE</A> for likely operators 
for each space group. 
If there is only one possibility for a spacegroup this will be used, and there
is no need to input an operator. Otherwise it is COMPULSORY.
<p>
For example for P31
either  OPERATOR -h,-k, l<br>
or      OPERATOR  k, h,-l<br>
or      OPERATOR -k,-h,-l

<H3><A NAME="plot"></A>PLOT &lt;string&gt; </h3> 
<p>
If string is set to MURR, a Murray-Rust plot of |Fo1|/|Fo2| is generated. 
There is no debug information possible. 
(See <A HREF="#reference5">reference [5]</A>.)


<H3><A NAME="twin_fraction"></A>TWIN_FRACTION &lt;alpha&gt; </h3>
<p>
If this is given, an output MTZ file will be written to HKLOUT with Is or Fs
corrected assuming the twin fraction  &lt;alpha&gt;.
It is difficult to estimate the twinfrac accurately unless the data is of very good
quality, but look at all the information plotted.
To carry out the exhaustive TRUNCATE tests you will need to run the program several 
times and look at the resulting intensity statistics.  The value which 
gives the best fit to the theoretical distribution for the acentric terms 
should be used.
Alternatively, run the Uppsala program &quot;dataman&quot; (keyword GEminin)
which will estimate the twin fraction.
<p>
Once a refined model has been obtained, it is possible to use the
Fcalc values from this model to obtain a better estimate of the
twin fraction (not yet implemented).


<H3><A NAME="labin"></A>LABIN &lt;program label&gt;=&lt;file label&gt;...</H3>

<P>Specify input column labels. [OPTIONAL INPUT] </P>

<P>Truncate takes output from SCALA and SCALEPACK2MTZ which generate
standard labels. This is the most common usage of the program, in
which case LABIN records are not required.</P>

<P>The program labels defined are: F SIGF IMEAN SIGIMEAN F(+) SIGF(+) F(-) SIGF(-) I(+) SIGI(+) I(-) SIGI(-)</P>

NB: Only F/SIGF or IMEAN/SIGIMEAN or F(+) F(-) SIGF(+) SIGF(-) or I(+) I(-) SIGI(+) SIGI(-) 
can be assigned.
If F(+-) or I(+-) are assigned the anomalous pairs are detwinned.
