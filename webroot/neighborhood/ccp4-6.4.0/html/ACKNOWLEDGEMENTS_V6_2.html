<P>

<p>CCP4 relies on the contribution of programs and software from many
protein crystallographers. We would like to thank all contributing
software authors for their efforts and their generosity in allowing us
to distribute their code, thus making it available to a wide community
of users. Details of authors of individual programs are given in the
corresponding <a href="INDEX.html">program documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A large number of people have also given their time and energy
to test this version of the CCP4, and to report and fix bugs. We would
like to acknowledge these people (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kevin Cowtan, Andrey Lebedev, Fei Long (York)
  <li>Phil Evans (MRC Cambridge)
  <li>Randy Read, Gabor Bunkozci (Cambridge)
  <li>Clemens Vonrhein, Claus Flensburg (Global Phasing)
  <li>Ralph Grosse-Kunstleve, Jeff Head (Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory)
  <li>Raj Pannu, Pavol Skubak (Leiden)
  <li>Matsuura Takanori (Osaka)
  <li>Tim Gruene (Gottingen)
  <li>Toro Imre
</ul>

<p>Finally, we would like to thank all those people who made contributions
which are not explicitly acknowledged here, which includes all program authors
who contributed new or updated versions of their software. CCP4 remains a 
collaborative effort and as such these releases would not possible without your
help and assistance.</p>

<p><b>Thank you!</b></p>
