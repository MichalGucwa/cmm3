<h2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></h2>

<p>In protein crystallographic refinement, it is quite important to avoid false 
water molecules introducing noise in the electron density map.  
If non-crystallographic symmetry exists in the crystal, many water 
molecules which bind to the protein should also follow the NCS of their host 
proteins. The WATNCS program can pick those which follow operations from all 
the water candidates calculated from 
difference fourier maps. It can also sort them into each NCS asymmetric 
unit, in order to introduce NCS restraint in the crystallographic 
refinement. In the first few cycles of adding water, such a procedure
is a powerful way of steering the refinement in the right direction.</p>
<p>WATNCS reads in the coordinate file (in PDB format) and NCS operations. 
The groups of atoms satisfying all NCS operations will be written out
by the program into a file with identical residue numbers but different chain 
names so that some refinement programs such as XPLOR or <a href="refmac5.html">REFMAC</a> can recognise
them as NCS equivalent atoms. The program can also write out atoms which only 
partially satisfy NCS operations (for example satisfy 2 of 3 NCSs).</p>

<h3><a name="pdb"></a>PDB &lt;filname&gt;</h3>
<p>Input file name of the water molecules</p>

<h3><a name="out"></a>OUT &lt;filenam&gt;</h3>
<p>Out file name of the water molecules</p>

<h3><a name="mol"></a>MOL &lt;filename&gt;  (alternative)</h3>
<p>Input filename of protein molecule. 
This is used when you want to sort the chain name of water molecule
according the chain name of protein molecule. If you have a 2-fold
rotation NCS (or 222 fold symmetry), the protein file is also helpful to
put water molecule into the &quot;right asymmetric unit&quot;. See <a href="#group">GROUP</a>.
Note: the file must NOT contain any water molecule.</p>

<h3><a name="relate"></a>RELATE 3*4 matrix - a11,a21,a31,a12,a22,a32,a12,a23,a33,tx,ty,tz</h3>
<p><pre>

X2 = (a21 a22 a23)*X1 + (ty)
     (a31 a32 a33)      (tz)
</pre>
The NCS rotation and translation (the matrix must start on another line).
The translation should be in orthogonal coordinates (assuming the PDB
file is).
If you have coordinates of protein molecules, the matrix can be obtained
from the program <a href="http://bioinfo1.mbfys.lu.se/~guoguang/fit.html">FIT</a> or O. 
The command can be repeated.
If you use the FIT program, there is an output file MATRIX which contains
this matrix. If you use the O program, you can use lsq_exp to obtain the matrix
to some like lsq_rt_atob. Then you write to a file by command
&quot;write .lsq_rt_atob filename (3f10.6)&quot;. You can get the matrix in the file.</p>

<h3><a name="error"></a>ERROR &lt;error&gt;</h3>
<p>Allowed error range of NCS related water molecules. I recommend 2-3 times the 
RMS value of protein superposition or 1/3 of data resolution.</p>

<h3><a name="least"></a>LEAST &lt;least&gt;</h3>
<p>Minimum number of NCS operations which selected waters must follow.
In the example file, there is a NCS of 222 symmetry. That means there
are 3 NCS operations. If 4 water molecule which follow this 222
symmetry, the program will think all the 3 NCS operations are satisfied, 
so it will write out these 4 atoms with an identical residue number but
chain names (W,U,V and X in this case). If 1 of the atoms is missing, the
program will think 2 operations are satisfied. In the example file least=2, 
the program will still write them out, but with another chain ID (Y)
and non identical residue numbers. If 2 of the 4 atoms are missing, the
program only thinks 1 NCS operation is satisfied and it is smaller than
the least requirement 2 here. So they will not be written to the output file.
If you need them output two, you have to change the command into &quot;LEAST 1&quot;.
Default same as NCS operation number.</p>

<h3><a name="chain"></a>CHAIN &lt;chain1&gt; &lt;chain2&gt; ....</h3>
<p>Chain name for output waters. If you have 3 NCS operations, waters
with the first 4 chain name should be able to apply NCS restraint.
In fact, it is possible to apply NCS restraint to all the water
molecules output from this program by looking at the log file and write
command in the refinement program carefully although I believe most people
only have the patience to use the restraint recommended by the program.</p>

<h3><a name="group"></a>GROUP &lt;Chain_water&gt; &lt;Chain_protein&gt;</h3>
<p>In the case of  2-fold symmetry, the program might put water
molecule in a &quot;wrong&quot; NCS asymmetric unit (giving a wrong chain name). It is 
not a problem at all for NCS restraint. However if you want to assign the
water molecule to the right protein, you have to input the protein
coordinates and tell the program which water chain name corresponds to
which protein chain name. In the example file, output waters with chain W
will belong to protein A...... See also <a href="#mol">MOL</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="number"></a>NUMBER &lt;number&gt;</h3>
<p>For those water molecules for NCS restraint, the output residue 
number will start after this number.</p>

<h3><a name="num2"></a>NUM2 &lt;num2&gt;</h3>
<p>For those water molecules not for NCS restraint, the output residue 
number will start after this number.</p>

<h3><a name="atom"></a>ATOM &lt;atomname&gt;</h3>
<p>If this command is present, the water atoms will be output with the 
given atom name instead of the name from input file.</p>

<h3><a name="residue"></a>RESIDUE &lt;HOH&gt;</h3>
<p>If this command is present, the water atoms will be output with the 
given residue name instead of the name from input file.</p>

<h3><a name="occu"></a>OCCU &lt;occupancy_value&gt;</h3>
<p>If this command is present, the water atoms will be output with the 
given occupancy value instead of the value from input file.</p>

<h3><a name="temp"></a>TEMP &lt;Bfactor&gt;</h3>
<p>If this command is present, the water atoms will be output with the
given B factor instead of the value from input file.</p>

<h2><a name="more_hints"></a>More Hints </h2>
<p><b>Automatically adding waters to models with NCS</b><br />
The author recommends adding waters after all or most of the protein atoms 
have been defined. Then one can perform the following steps.
<ol>
<li>Calculate an Fo-Fc map</li>
<li>Search peaks from the map with a peak searching program (such as <a href="peakmax.html">PEAKMAX</a>
in CCP4)</li>
<li>Run a stereo chemistry filtering program to select waters which have good
interactions with protein (or other waters). I use PEAKCHECK written by Janet Smith.
(I think <a href="watpeak.html">watpeak</a> in CCP4 will do a similar job).</li>
<li>Use watncs to get rid of the molecules which do not fit NCS. Usually
in the first cycle, I only use waters which satisfy all the NCS. In the 2nd or
3rd cycle, I allow waters which fit some of the NCSs. There is almost no
chance of false peaks which fit both the stereochemistry and NCSs, so
the user almost does not have to check these new added waters interactively 
on graphics</li>
<li>For those waters which fit all the NCS, introduce NCS restraint in the
refinement program.</li>
<li>Repeat 1 to 5 until R-free converges. Those old waters which do not 
have all NCS related mates (Y chain waters in the example files) 
must be input together with new waters, otherwise some &quot;good waters&quot; which
appear from a improved electron density map and  NCS-related to old waters 
might be missed.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>There are always real water molecules which do not follow NCSs because
of packing or other reasons. One has to run the above procedure without
WATNCS at least once and check these water molecules interactively. 
However this should be in the last few cycles.</p>
<p>The automatic procedure cannot prevent the addition of waters to sites which
protein atoms should occupy (when protein atoms are mis-placed to some
other sites). However, statistically most water molecules are correct
and the procedure can significantly improve the map, the problem can be
show up automatically by listing the atoms with negative values in Fo-Fc
map using the 
<a href="http://bioinfo1.mbfys.lu.se/~guoguang/diflist.html">DIFLIST</a> program.</p>
<p>One cannot prevent some compounds such as citrate being identified 
as waters. In this case, I think users can find out the problem by only 
checking the protein atoms but not checking all the waters.</p>
<p>The advantage of the above automatic procedure is to make sure all the water
molecules in the first few cycles are real. The map is improved by
real molecules and NCS restraint. Later water adding would be based on 
better maps.</p>
