<h2><a name="description"></a> DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>Vector-space refinement is an alternative to the standard
reciprocal-space refinement of Busing &amp; Levy (<a href="#reference1">[1]</a>); instead of
least-squares minimisation of the sum of weighted squared
differences between observed and calculated structure factor
amplitudes with respect to the atomic parameters, we minimise
the same function of the observed and calculated heavy-atom
difference Patterson function values.</p>
<p>Although the Patterson function is a complete representation in
vector space of the set of structure factor amplitudes (provided
the Patterson function is sampled at a sufficiently fine
interval), the two types of refinement are not equivalent.  This
is because the minimisation in vector space is only done for
sample points where the calculated Patterson density is
significantly positive, in other words near the interatomic
vector peaks, whereas each structure factor contains information
from all points in real space (except in special zones).  In all
real crystal structures the atoms fill all the space (there are
no holes), so there would be no advantage with vector-space
refinement; indeed there would be problems due to considerable
overlap of peaks in vector space.</p>
<p>For a difference structure the situation is reversed; most of
the space is empty and the probability of overlaps is small; and
since the structure factors represent mostly empty space, they
are dominated by errors arising from taking a small difference
between large quantities with small relative errors.  As a
result, reciprocal-space refinement of heavy-atom parameters is
notoriously slow to converge and insensitive to misplaced sites
and to errors in the starting values of the parameters, and
refinement statistics usually give little indication of the
correctness of the solution.  (Typical conventional R-factors
for reciprocal-space heavy-atom refinement are in the range 30% 
(rarely) to 70%, usually around 50%, compared with the random
value for acentric data of 58.6%.)</p>
<p>The theoretical convergence radius for reciprocal-space
refinement is dmin/4, <em>i.e.</em> 0.75&Aring; at 3&Aring;, but this is unlikely to be
achieved in practice because of random errors; for vector-space
refinement the theoretical convergence radius is the apparent
atomic diameter, which is about dmin/sqrt(2), <em>i.e.</em> about 2.1&Aring; at 3&Aring;.</p>
<p>Vector-space refinement also has the considerable advantage over
reciprocal-space refinement in that it is possible to perform
the least-squares fit to the 3-dimensional data set using only
isomorphous differences, so that heavy-atom derivatives for
which no anomalous scattering data are available (or are of
dubious reliability) can be refined using information from all
data, centric and acentric.  In this case it is important to
have the derivative data already scaled accurately against the
native data, as the derivative scale-factor cannot be refined in
real space.  The Kraut scaling technique (<a href="#reference2">[2]</a>) is recommended
for this; see the documentation for program 
<a href="fhscal.html">FHSCAL</a>.</p>
<p>In vector space, there exists no procedure corresponding to the
heavy-atom difference Fourier for finding minor sites.  However
other options which utilise the Patterson, such as superposition
methods, are available, and of course one can still calculate
structure factors from the refined atomic parameters and do a
difference Fourier.</p>

</blockquote></p>
<p>The keywords SPACEGROUP, RESOLUTION, CYCLES and ATOM are always
required, the rest are optional, and assume default values if
omitted.</p>
<h3><a name="title"></a> TITLE &lt;title&gt;</h3>
<p>Title (max 100 characters).</p>
<h3><a name="spacegroup"></a> SPACEGROUP &lt;space_group&gt;</h3>
<p>Space group name (<em>e.g.</em> P212121) or number (<em>e.g.</em> 19).</p>
<h3><a name="resolution"></a> RESOLUTION &lt;d_min&gt; [&lt;d_max&gt;]</h3>
<p>Approximate minimum and maximum d-spacings (high and low
resolution cutoffs respectively; may be given either way
round) of the data used to compute the Patterson map.
d_max may be omitted, in which case no low resolution
cutoff is assumed.</p>
<h3><a name="rcut"></a> RCUT &lt;radius&gt;</h3>
<p>Radius cutoff for Patterson peaks.  The default radius is
defined by the point where the density either becomes zero
or a minimum; this is usually satisfactory.  If RCUT is
positive the radius is taken as a RCUT times the RMS radius.
Note that the RMS radius is typically 0.5-0.6 times the
default radius, so there is no point setting RCUT above
about 1.5.  If RCUT is negative, the radius (in Angstrom)
is taken as abs(RCUT).</p>
<h3><a name="group"></a> GROUP &lt;gs&gt; &lt;as1&gt; &lt;w1&gt; &lt;r1&gt; &lt;as2&gt; &lt;w2&gt; &lt;r2&gt;</h3>
<p>Group symbol, any 2 characters used to represent the group
scatterer, <em>e.g.</em> HI for HgI4-- (do not use a symbol which
could be confused with an atomic symbol).</p>
<p>Atomic symbol, multiplicity and radius for the first type
of atom in the group; <em>i.e.</em> if this is the central atom then
w1 = 1 and r1 = 0.</p>
<p>Repeat for the second type of atom (optional).</p>

<h3><a name="cycles"></a> CYCLES &lt;ncyc1&gt; &lt;ncyc2&gt; &lt;ncyc3&gt;</h3>
<p>The program will perform &lt;ncyc1&gt; cycles of refinement of the 
occupancy factors (usually 3 to 5, possibly up to 10 for difficult cases),
followed by &lt;ncyc2&gt; cycles of refinement of the occupancies and
coordinates (usually about 5), and finally &lt;ncyc3&gt; cycles
of refinement of all variables (occupancies, coordinates and thermal 
parameters) (usually 10-20).</p>

<h3><a name="origin"></a> ORIGIN</h3>
<p>Specify to include Patterson origin.
Usually exclude, except in the case of 1 atom in space group
P1, when the origin is the only vector.  See <a href="#note5">note 5</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="scale"></a> SCALE &lt;scale(i)&gt;</h3>
<p>Scale factors for the coordinates; if these are fractional
then scale(i) = 1 (this is the default).  If they are in
grid units (<em>i.e.</em> taken directly from a map) then scale(i) =
number of grid units along each cell edge.  (These grid units
need not be the same as those used in the Patterson read by
the program.)</p>
<h3><a name="atom"></a> ATOM &lt;as&gt; &lt;iat&gt; &lt;occ&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; &lt;b&gt;</h3>

<dt>&lt;b&gt;</dt>
<dd>Thermal parameter (B-factor).</dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="aniso"></a> ANISO</h3>
<p>This is currently not operational.</p>
<h3><a name="brefine"></a> BREFINE</h3>
<p>Specify to refine individual isotropic thermal parameters
(ncyc3 must also be &gt; 0).  The default is to refine an
overall B factor (when ncyc3 &gt; 0).  See <a href="#note4">note 4</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="damp"></a> DAMP &lt;damp&gt;</h3>
<p>Damping factor for occupancy and B-factor shifts when
these are refined together.  The default value is 0.25.
The occupancies and B-factors are always highly correlated,
so without damping the shifts tend to oscillate.</p>
<h3><a name="threshold"></a> THRESHOLD &lt;trms&gt;</h3>
<p>Only atoms with refined occupancies above this threshold
times the estimated standard deviation are written to the
ATOUT file.  If threshold is given as negative, the absolute
value of the occupancy is tested, so that negative
occupancies may also be written out.  Default is 2 sigma.</p>
<h3><a name="blimits"></a> BLIMITS &lt;blim(1)&gt; &lt;blim(2)&gt;</h3>
<p>Only atoms with B factors within the specified limits are
accepted on input, and are written to the ATOUT file.
Defaults are 0 200.</p>
<h3><a name="end"></a> END</h3>
<p>Terminate input and start the calculation.</p>

<h2><a name="notes"></a> NOTES</h2>
<ol>
<li><a name="note1"></a>
Lattice type: The program takes account of
non-primitive lattices by multiplying the atomic form-factor by
the multiplicity factor. This means that the refined occupancies
are true occupancies, not multiplied by the lattice
multiplicity.</li>
<li><a name="note2"></a>
Map file: Great care must be taken in the preparation
of the map file, particularly with non-primitive space groups
such as C2, as the VECREF program may not be able to detect
mistakes made.  The most likely result of this is that you will
finish up with incorrect occupancies, and hence biased protein
phases.  The following points should be carefully observed: 
<ol type="a">
<li>It is recommended that Kraut scaling of the
derivative be used, with or without anomalous differences.
In the latter case the <a href="fhscal.html">FHSCAL</a> program can be used.
The scales and temperature factors
given to FFT will then be 1 and 0 respectively.  A bias
factor of 1 is recommended, but this is not critical.</li>
<li>It is a recommended that a list of the largest
isomorphous differences (or Fhle's) be checked for obvious
outliers and these rejected before the Patterson is computed,
otherwise these will strongly bias the occupancies.  A
convenient way of checking is to run a program which performs
analyses of the scaling in terms of the hkl indices, such as
<a href="scaleit.html">SCALEIT</a> or LOCAL, as large outliers usually stand out; the
fractional rms difference in F^2 is a particularly sensitive
check.  A low resolution cutoff <em>e.g.</em> 20&Aring; in FFT will often remove
most of the outliers, though this should be done with caution.</li>
<li>The number of sampling intervals specified affects 
critically the run-time of the VECREF run, <em>i.e.</em> inversely 
proportional to the cube of the size of the interval.  Normally
use an interval about 1/4th of the resolution, <em>i.e.</em> Nx = 4.hmax
etc.  The Patterson must of course constitute at least an
asymmetric unit in vector space, but it doesn't matter if it is
more than an asymmetric unit.</li>
<li>Use the VF000 map scaling option; for V use the value
computed by <a href="fhscal.html">FHSCAL</a>, or for Fhle Pattersons use the actual volume.
F000 should be 0 as VECREF computes the value from the occupancies
and scattering factors.</li>
</ol>
<li><a name="note3"></a>
Group scattering factors: These are useful for complex
ions like AuI4-, PtI6--, HgI4-- etc, where a substantial part of
the scattering arises from atoms not located at the centre of
the electron density.  The spherically averaged combined
scattering factor is used.</li>
<li><a name="note4"></a>
Thermal parameters: For low resolution (dmin &gt; &#126;4.5)
thermal parameters cannot be sensibly refined due to high
correlations with the occupancies, so this should then be zero,
otherwise about 5.
<br />
Usually when refining the thermal parameters, the R-factor
(residual) goes up initially and then converges slowly (due to
the high correlations), but not back as far as the level
attained by refining occupancies and coordinates alone.  This in
itself should not necessarily be taken to mean that the thermal
parameters are not meaningful.  This increases the peak widths and
hence the number of observations; this by itself will tend to
push up the R-factor, but also the extra observations will be in
the tails of the peaks where the signal to noise ratio is poor.</li>
<li><a name="note5"></a>
Patterson origin: The program should normally be
instructed to ignore the origin peak for the purposes of
least-squares unless you are confident there is no systematic
discrepancy between the observed and calculated origin peak
heights, as there usually is, probably because of random errors
and/or missing sites.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="output"></a> PRINTER OUTPUT</h2>
<p>The refined atomic parameters appear in a table under the 
following headings:
<pre>Atom  Parameter  Init  Old  Shift  Change  New  Esd
</pre></p>
<dl> 
<dt>Atom</dt>
<dd>the atom or group symbols and identifiers.</dd>
<dt>Parameter</dt> 
<dd>the names of the atomic parameters
being refined.</dd>

<dd>Under Shift appear, on the same line as the atom name, the
net shifts in Angstrom for the current cycle, and, on the same
line as the parameter name, the shifts for the current cycle in
the same units as the corresponding parameter.</dd>
<dt>Change</dt> 
<dd>Under Change appear, on the same line as the atom name, the
net shifts in Angstrom from the initial values, and, on the same
line as the parameter name, the shifts from the initial values
in the same units as the corresponding parameter.</dd>
<dt>New</dt> 
<dd>the new values of the parameters for the
current cycle.</dd>
<dt>Esd</dt> 
<dd>Under Esd appear, on the same line as the atom name, the
estimated standard deviation of the atomic position in Angstrom,
and, on the same line as the parameter name, the estimated
standard deviations of the parameters in the same units as the
corresponding parameter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Atoms are not allowed to shift from their initial position by
more than twice the expected convergence radius (approximately
dmin*sqrt(2)); atoms for which the calculated shift would take
them over this limit have their occupancy set to zero; the
occupancy is then allowed to refine upwards only if the
coordinate shifts move the atom back towards its initial
position.  Atoms with occupancy exactly zero are ignored on 
input; if this effect is not desired, alter the zero occupancy 
to some small number (<em>e.g.</em> 0.001).</p>
<p>I have not yet had sufficient experience with the program to
know what constitute good R-factors and correlation
coefficients, or which statistic to place the greatest reliance
on, though the R-factor seems to be more discriminating.  The
best result I have had so far is R = 17.5%, C = 0.976,
(excluding the Patterson origin, and not refining B-factors) for
the test data distributed with the program.  Note this is real
data !  (Acknowledgements to Dr. Simon Phillips, University of
Leeds.)</p>
<p>The list of vectors, which appears after the occupancy
refinement cycles and again at the end of the run, has the
Patterson map coordinates in the same units as the atomic
coordinates if these were supplied as map grid coordinates, or
in the same units as the map supplied if the atomic coordinates
were supplied as fractions of a unit cell.  The columns labelled
Pobs, Pcalc, and &lt;Pobs&gt;, &lt;Pcalc&gt; are approximate peak heights
and mean peak values respectively. They are intended only as a
guide to the fit; in particular the Pcalc values do not include
a contribution from any overlapping peaks.  (These are not the
data used in the least squares, where the fit is done on a grid
point basis, not on a peak basis.)</p>
<h2><a name="errors"></a> ERRORS</h2>
<p>One or more of the following messages occur when errors are
discovered in the input control data; the program continues to
process the data but stops when all data has been read:
<pre>

   *** ERROR: Centring translation not integer.
   *** ERROR: Identity position not found.
   *** ERROR: Invalid number of atoms.
   *** ERROR: Atom symbol not in scat. fact. list.
   *** ERROR IN GETINP: Error(s) in input data.

</pre></p>
<p>The following conditions indicate that an array is not large
enough for the problem and should be cured either by correcting
the input data (in most cases by increasing the sampling
interval of the Patterson), or by increasing the value assigned
to the symbol specified in PARAMETER statements in the source
code, taking care to modify all PARAMETER statements containing
the symbol, and re-compiling and linking. 
<pre>

   *** ERROR: Array bound check (MSECT).
   *** ERROR: Array bound check (MRHO).
   *** ERROR IN ADDAST: Array bound check (MCF).
   *** ERROR IN PKLIST: Array bound check (MPL).
   *** ERROR IN GENPTS: Array bound check (MPT).

</pre></p>
<p>The following conditions are likely to occur if either the
symmetry specified is wrong, or the Patterson map is less
than an asymmetric unit:
<pre>

   *** ERROR: Point not found.
   *** ERROR IN GENPTS: No points.

</pre></p>
<p>The following errors occur when the standard map handling 
routine detects an error; this is likely to indicate
something seriously wrong with the map file, like data
corruption:
<pre>

   *** ERROR IN PKLIST: MGULP error.
   *** ERROR IN REFCYC: MGULP error.

</pre></p>
<h2><a name="program_description"></a> PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>One important point often not clearly understood about this
method of refinement is that the program does handle overlapping
vectors correctly, provided first that the overlap is between
known atoms and second that not all vectors arising from a pair
of atoms overlap.  This is because the calculated Patterson
density is summed over all contributing atom pairs before being
compared with the observed value.  Vectors which overlap with
those due to as yet unknown atoms will positively bias the
occupancy, and will also affect the refined coordinates, but
this is also true for the reciprocal-space method.</p>
