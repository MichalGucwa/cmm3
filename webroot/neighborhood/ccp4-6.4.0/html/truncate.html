<h1>TRUNCATE (CCP4: Supported Program)</h1>

<h2>NAME</h2>
<b>truncate </b>
- obtain structure factor amplitudes using Truncate procedure and/or generate useful intensity statistics

<h2>SYNOPSIS </h2>

<p><b>truncate hklin</b> <i>foo_in.mtz</i> <b>hklout</b> <i>foo_out.mtz</i>
[ <b>plot</b> <i>foo.plt</i> ]
<br />
[<a href="#keywords">Keyworded input</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="description"></a>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The standard use of the program is to read a file of averaged intensities (output from
<a href="scala.html">SCALA</a>, <a href="scalepack2mtz.html">SCALEPACK2MTZ</a>
or <a href="dtrek2mtz.html">DTREK2MTZ</a>)
and write a file containing mean amplitudes and the original intensities.
If anomalous data is present then F(+), F(-), with the anomalous difference,
plus I(+) and I(-) are also written out. The amplitudes are put on an approximate
absolute scale using the scale factor taken from a Wilson plot.</p>

<p>There are two ways in TRUNCATE to calculate the amplitudes from the
intensities. The simplest is just to take the square root of the intensities,
setting any negative ones to zero (keyword TRUNCATE NO). Alternatively,
the "truncate" procedure (keyword TRUNCATE YES, the default) calculates a
best estimate of F from I, sd(I), and the distribution of intensities in
resolution shells (see <a href="#ranges">below</a>). 
This has the effect of forcing all negative
observations to be positive, and inflating the weakest reflections (less
than about 3 sd), because an observation significantly smaller than the
average intensity is likely to be underestimated. See <a href="#references">reference</a>
below.</p>

<p>If the input specified on the LABIN line includes an assignment for F, then 
no output will be generated.  It is most undesirable to TRUNCATE a set of data 
where the intensities have already been modified to generate amplitudes.</p>

<p>This program can be used even if the "truncate" procedure is not desired,
since it produces some useful statistics on intensity distributions. 
These
can indicate problems with the data; for instance if the data  is extremely
anisotropic (see the <a href="#falloff">FALLOFF</a> keyword) or if it is likely 
to be twinned. See the cumulative intensity distribution plot, which for a 
perfect twinning becomes sigmoidal, and the moments of E (or Z) which are different 
for twinned data than for untwinned. If there are indications of twinning they
will be noted as warnings in the log file. </p>

<p>The scale factor estimated from the Wilson plot is applied to the data
and allows the data to be put on a (very approximate) absolute scale. This
at least gives amplitudes of a sensible magnitude for further calculations.
The calculation relies on the number of residues/atoms given by the keywords
NRESIDUE/CONTENTS being roughly correct. The program does not, however,
apply any temperature factor.</p>

<h3>Moments of the intensities</h3>

<p><b>Note:</b> this is the same test as before, but the description
is now in terms of the normalised structure factor E or the normalised
intensity Z, since this takes into account correctly the symmetry
factor epsilon and the normalisation.</p>

<p>We define a reduced intensity I' = I / epsilon, where epsilon is the 
symmetry factor which increases the mean intensities for certain planes or 
lines in reciprocal space. We also define Z = I' / &lt;I'&gt;  The general 
formulae for the expected moments of I' and Z
(where k-th moment of x = &lt;x^k&gt;) for untwinned acentric data are:</p>

<pre>

  k-th moment of I' = Gamma(k+1) * &lt;I'&gt;^k

  k-th moment of Z = Gamma(k+1)
                   = k!          if k is an integer

</pre>
The normalised structure amplitude is given by:
<pre>

  E = I'^(1/2) / &lt;I'&gt;^(1/2) = Z^(1/2)

</pre>
The moments of E can then be related to the half-integral moments of Z:
<pre>

  k-th moment of E = &lt;E^k&gt;  
                   = &lt;Z^(k/2)&gt; 
                   = Gamma(k/2+1)

</pre>
For k odd, this can be evaluated as:
<pre>

   k-th moment of E = Gamma(k/2+1)    with k odd
                    =  k/2 * (k/2 - 1) * ... * 0.5 * Gamma(1/2)
                    =  sqrt(PI) * k/2 * (k/2 - 1) * ... * 0.5

  e.g. &lt;E^3&gt;  = sqrt(PI) * 1.5 * 0.5 = 1.329

</pre>
For k even, &lt;E^k&gt; is simply (k/2)!
</p>

<p>One can also calculate expected moments for acentric data in the case of 
perfect twinning, and for untwinned and twinned centric data, giving:
<pre>
                    Acentric                        Centric
              Untwinned data  Perfect twin.   Untwinned data  Perfect twin.
  &lt;E&gt;             0.886         0.94               0.798       0.886 
  &lt;E^3&gt;           1.329         1.175              1.596       1.329
  &lt;E^4&gt;           2.0           1.5                3.0         2.0
  &lt;E^6&gt;           6.0           3.0               15.0         6.0 
  &lt;E^8&gt;          24.0           7.5              105.0        24.0 

</pre>
Truncate outputs these moments for comparison against these expected values.

<h2>DESCRIPTION OF KEYWORDS</h2>

<h3><a name="title"></a>TITLE &lt;title&gt;</h3>

<p>(default TITLE='From Truncate') [OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>Title to write to output reflection file</p>

<h3><a name="ranges"></a>RANGES &lt;nrange&gt; | &lt;range&gt;</h3>

<p>(Default &lt;nrange&gt;=60) [OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>&lt;nrange&gt; is the number of resolution bins over the resolution
range for the Wilson Plot. &lt;range&gt; is the width of the bins on 4(sin
 theta/lambda)**2 and is an alterative to &lt;nrange&gt;. The resolution
range used for the Wilson Plot is taken from the input data file, or set
with the RESOLUTION keyword. A subset of these bins, covering a resolution
range defined with the RSCALE keyword, is used to estimate the scale and
B-factor.<br />
The use of this card is discouraged, as the choice of the number of bins
is important. Too few bins and the scale and overall B will be less accurate.
Too few reflections per bin could mean a large scattering of points from
the straight line. This would mean a large uncertainty in the values for
scale and B.<br />
If this card is omitted, the program divides the resolution range into
60 bins, then checks that there are not less than 40 reflections in any
one bin and if necessary reduces the number of bins until the above condition
is satisfied. In all cases, the program will stop if the width of ranges
is greater than 0.03 or the number of bins is greater than 60.</p>

<h3><a name="resolution"></a>RESOLUTION &lt;Dmin&gt; &lt;Dmax&gt;</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>Resolution limits - either 4(sin theta/lambda)**2 or d in Angstroms
(either order). Reflections outside these limits will be excluded from
all analysis and omitted on output. Defaults are taken from the range of
data in the input file (<em>i.e.</em> all data included).</p>

<h3><a name="rscale"></a>RSCALE &lt;Dmin&gt; &lt;Dmax&gt;</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>Resolution limits for scaling (either 4(sin theta/lambda)**2 or d).
This option allows you to exclude low resolution reflections from the calculation
of the scale and B factor. However, all points in the range defined by
RESO are plotted on the Wilson plot. It is probably a good idea to include
only high resolution data (beyond 3A, if you have any data there) in the
Wilson plot. This is because the assumptions behind Wilson statistics are
invalid for low resolution data. The default high resolution limit is the
same as RESOLUTION. The low resolution limit is, by default, set to 4.0A
if the high res. limit is greater than 3.5A.</p>

<h3><a name="scale"></a>SCALE &lt;scale&gt;</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>The default is to apply a scale factor from the Wilson plot. If a scale
factor is given here, then that is applied instead.
This option is useful if relative scaling is already done in SCALA.</p>

<p>If amplitudes rather than intensities are specified on the LABIN line,
then the Wilson scale is <em>not</em> applied, and a default scale
of 100 is used.</p>

<h3><a name="falloff"></a>FALLOFF YES | NO [ CONE &lt;cone&gt; ] [ PLTX | PLTY ]</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>The first argument of the FALLOFF keyword should be &quot;YES&quot; or &quot;NO&quot;,
followed optionally by subkeywords controlling the detailed behaviour. 
The default is &quot;YES&quot;, which triggers an analysis of the anisotropy of
the data according to the &quot;falloff&quot; procedure contributed by Yorgo Modis. 
This calculates the falloff of mean F and mean F/sigma values as a 
function of (sin theta/lambda)**2
in 3 orthogonal directions. An overall falloff of all reflections is also 
calculated. The 3 mutually perpendicular directions are:</p>
<pre> 

        DIRECTION 2 = B*-AXIS 
        DIRECTION 3 = PERPENDICULAR TO A* AND B*
        DIRECTION 1 = PERPENDICULAR TO B* AND DIRECTION 3.

</pre> 
<p>If either of the subkeywords PLTX or PLTY are specified, then
an output plot file (PLOT) is produced, in which Direction 1 is
plotted as a thick line, Direction 2 is plotted as a hollow line with
boxes at regular intervals of resolution, and Direction 3 is plotted
as a thin line.  The resolution range and number of resolution bins
used in the calculation can be set by the keywords <a
href="#resolution">RESOLUTION</a> and <a href="#ranges">RANGES</a>
respectively.</p>

<p>Subkeywords:</p>
<dl>
<dt>CONE &lt;cone&gt;</dt>
<dd>The falloff of mean F-values along each orthogonal direction is calculated
using reflections falling within a cone orientated along that direction.
&lt;cone&gt; is the angle the surface of the cone makes with the associated
direction. Reflections which are located at a greater angle than 
&lt;cone&gt; from the closest direction will not be included in the falloff 
calculations.<br /> 
Default: 30.0 degrees.</dd>
<dt>PLTX | PLTY</dt>
<dd>Produce an output plot file (PLOT) and orientate it horizontally 
or vertically.<br />
Default is horizontally (PLTX).</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="labin"></a>LABIN &lt;program label&gt;=&lt;file label&gt;...</h3>

<p>Specify input column labels. [OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>Truncate takes output from SCALA, SCALEPACK2MTZ or DTREK2MTZ which generate
standard labels. This is the most common usage of the program, in
which case LABIN records are not required. If F is assigned, there will be no
reflections output. You must assign either IMEAN/SIGIMEAN or F/SIGF.</p>

<p>The program labels defined are: 
IMEAN SIGIMEAN I(+) SIGI(+) I(-) SIGI(-)  F SIGF FreeR_flag</p>

<p>The labels allowed are F SIGF DANO SIGDANO F(+) SIGF(+) F(-) SIGF(-)
IMEAN SIGIMEAN I(+) SIGI(+) I(-) SIGI(-) FreeR_flag ISYM. The output labels will default
to these unless they are changed by assigning a program label to a user
label.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If there is no anomalous data present then only the appropriate columns
(F, SIGF, IMEAN and SIGIMEAN) are output. Values may be given in any order
and as either Proglabel=Userlabel or Userlabel=Proglabel.</p>

<h3><a name="contents"></a>CONTENTS &lt;symbol&gt; &lt;n&gt; ...</h3>

<p>[ALTERNATIVE COMPULSORY INPUT]</p>

<p>followed by number of atoms in asymmetric unit, including hydrogens</p>

<p>A maximum of 20 atom (element) types is allowed, each followed by a
number, <em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre>  CONTENTS  H 746 C  454  N 115    O 139   S 12  ! Must include hydrogens
</pre>

<p>The average scattering power is calculated from a table of form factors.
By default the file $CLIBD/atomsf.lib contains this table of form factors.
You can change the table used by assigning 'ATOMSF' to your preferred file.
[NOTE the program <a href="rwcontents.html">RWCONTENTS</a> provides the
information for this keyword; how many Carbons etc., from a PDB file. Also,
it gives an estimate of the number of hydrogens there would be.]</p>

<h3><a name="nresidue"></a>NRESIDUE &lt;Nres&gt;</h3>

<p>[ALTERNATIVE COMPULSORY INPUT]</p>

<p>&lt;Nres&gt; is the number of residues expected in the asymmetric unit</p>

<p>A very approximate atom composition is calculated:</p>

<pre>    mean mass of an amino acid = 110
    add on one ordered water per amino acid = ca. 128
</pre>

<p>This is then taken as 5 C + 1.35 N + 1.5 O + 8 H /residue as number of atoms
in asymmetric unit.</p>

<h3><a name="vpat"></a>VPAT &lt;vpat&gt;</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>volume per atom - default = 10</p>

<h3><a name="plot"></a>PLOT [ ON | OFF ]</h3>

<p>PLOT or PLOT ON produces extra ascii plots in the log output. The default

<p>History strings to be added to history records in output file</p>

<h3><a name="anomalous"></a>ANOMALOUS YES | NO</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>Controls whether anomalous differences are output. Defaults YES if anomalous
information is present on input file, otherwise NO</p>

<h3><a name="truncate"></a>TRUNCATE YES | NO</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>If YES (default) the data will be truncated according to the procedure
of <a href="#references">French and Wilson</a>. If NO the data are not
truncated but the structure amplitudes are calculated simply by taking
the square root of the intensities. Negative intensities are set to zero.</p>

<h3><a name="symmetry"></a>SYMMETRY &lt;space_group&gt; | &lt;number&gt;</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>Default is to use symmetry in input HKLIN file. (Normally OMIT this
command.)</p>

<h3><a name="cell"></a>CELL &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt; [ &lt;alpha&gt;
&lt;beta&gt; &lt;gamma&gt; ]</h3>

<p>[OPTIONAL INPUT]</p>

<p>The cell dimensions in Angstroms and degrees. The angles default to
90 degrees. If this key is omitted then the cell dimensions are taken from
the input file (normally OMIT this command)</p>

<h2>Data Harvesting keywords</h2>

<p>Provided a Project Name and a Dataset Name are specified (either explicitly 
or from the MTZ file) and provided the <a href="#noharvest">NOHARVEST</a>
keyword is not given, the program will automatically produce a data harvesting 
file. This file will be written to</p>

<p><tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt>/<tt>DepositFiles</tt>/<i>&lt;projectname&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;datasetname&gt;.truncate</i></p>

<p>The environment variable <tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt> defaults to the user's
home directory, but could be changed, for example, to a group project
directory. When running the program through the CCP4 interface, the $HARVESTHOME variable defaults to the 'PROJECT' directory.</p>

<p>Dataset information in the input MTZ file header includes a Project Name
and a Dataset Name for each dataset. These will be used to define the
harvest file, unless overridden by the PNAME and DNAME keywords. Note that
the latter <b>only</b> affect the harvest file, and do not change the
header information of the output MTZ file. Editing of dataset information
can be done with the program <a href="cad.html">CAD</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="pname">PNAME</a>&lt;project_name&gt;</h3>

<p>Project Name. In most cases, this will be inherited from the MTZ file.<br />
A dataset, as listed in the MTZ header, defines a project-name/dataset-name
pair. The project-name specifies a particular structure solution project,
while the dataset-name specifies a particular dataset contributing to the
structure solution. An entry in the PNAME keyword should therefore be
accompanied by a corresponding entry in the <a href="#dname">DNAME</a> keyword.</p>

<h3><a name="dname">DNAME</a> &lt;dataset_name&gt; </h3>

<p>Dataset Name. In most cases, this will be inherited from the MTZ file.<br />
A dataset, as listed in the MTZ header, defines a project-name/dataset-name
pair. The project-name specifies a particular structure solution project,
while the dataset-name specifies a particular dataset contributing to the
structure solution. An entry in the DNAME keyword should therefore be
accompanied by a corresponding entry in the <a href="#pname">PNAME</a> keyword.</p>

<h3><a name="private">PRIVATE</a></h3>

<p>Set the directory permissions to '700', <em>i.e.</em> read/write/execute for
the user only (default '755').</p>

<h3><a name="usecwd">USECWD</a></h3>

<p>Write the deposit file to the current directory, rather than a
subdirectory of $HARVESTHOME. This can
be used to send deposit files from speculative runs to the local directory
rather than the official project directory, or can be used 
when the program is being run on a machine without access to the directory
<tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt>.</p>

<h3><a name="rsize">RSIZE</a> &lt;row_length&gt; </h3>

<p>Maximum width of a row in the deposit file (default 80).
&lt;row_length&gt; should be between 80 and 132 characters.</p>

<h3><a name="noharvest">NOHARVEST</a></h3>

<p>Do not write out a deposit file; default is to do so provided Project
and Dataset names are available.</p>

<h2><a name="files"></a>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</h2>

<p><b>The input files are:</b></p>

<ol type="a">

</li>

<li>PLOT - plot file showing fall-off of mean F in 3 perpendicular
directions.
<blockquote>
Produced if either of the subkeywords PLTX or PLTY of the
<a href="#falloff">FALLOFF</a> keyword are specified.
This can be viewed with <a href="xplot84driver.html">XPLOT84DRIVER</a>,
or converted to postscript with <a href="pltdev.html">PLTDEV</a>.
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>PRINTER OUTPUT</h2>

<p>The printer output starts with details of the control data and details
of the input MTZ reflection data file. Analyses of the data against resolution
are then given and include intensity distributions for comparison with Wilson's
theoretical distributions. The following graphs are output (which can be
viewed via <a href="xloggraph.html">XLOGGRAPH</a> or LOGGRAPH):</p>

<ul>
<li>Wilson plot.</li>
<li>Moments of the intensity for acentric and centric data. These plots may
indicate twinning, see <a href="#description">above</a>.</li>
<li>Cumulative intensity distribution for both acentric and centric data
compared to theoretical predictions. If twinning is present, these curves
become sigmoidal (and will therefore be shifted to the right of the 
theoretical curves for some or all of the plot), although anisotropic
diffraction can confuse this picture.</li>
<li>Plots of mean amplitude (F) and mean amplitude/standard deviation (F/sd)
calculated for the data in resolution shells, and plotted against resolution.</li>
<li>Mean F, mean F/sd and number of reflections calculated for data lying
in the region of 3 orthogonal directions d1, d2, d3 (see the 
<a href="#falloff">FALLOFF</a> keyword). Differences in the falloff rate
in the 3 directions indicates anisotropy of the data.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="function"></a>PROGRAM FUNCTION</h2>

<p>The program TRUNCATE reads a reflection data file of averaged intensities
(SCALA, SCALEPACK2MTZ or DTREK2MTZ output) and outputs an MTZ reflection data file
containing F and DeltaFanom values. The input intensities are assumed to
follow a normal distribution with the standard deviations, <em>i.e.</em> negative
observations must have been preserved. The truncation procedure used was
devised by <a href="#references">French and Wilson</a> and is based on
Bayesian statistics. The F's are calculated using the prior knowledge of
Wilson's distributions for acentric or centric data (calculated in shells
of reciprocal space in a first pass through the data) and the mean intensity
and standard deviation values. The F's output are all positive and follow
Wilson's distribution. The truncation procedure has little effect on reflections
larger than 3 standard deviations but should give significantly better
values for the weak data than those obtained by merely taking the square
root of the intensities and setting negative intensities to zero. Reflections
of less than minus four standard deviations are rejected.</p>

<p>The following warnings should be heeded:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li><p>Do not truncate data more than once, <em>e.g.</em> do not merge truncated
data with untruncated data and then truncate again.</p></li>

<li><p>The standard deviations are crucial to the procedure and the standard
deviation analysis from SCALA should be checked.</p></li>

<li><p>The procedure should not be used on data which has been forced to
be positive <em>e.g.</em> from ordinate analysis measurements on a diffractometer
or where negative observations have been set to zero.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>WILSON plot</h4>

<p>The Wilson plot part of the program attempts to calculate an absolute
scale and temperature factor for a set of observed intensities, using the
theory of A C Wilson. This says that IF the atoms are randomly distributed
through the asymmetric unit THEN</p>

<p>&lt;f**2&gt; should equal scale*&lt;Fobs**2&gt; * exp -2B(sin theta/lambda)**2</p>

<p>By fitting a least squares line through ln(&lt;f**2&gt;/&lt;Fobs**2&gt;)
v 2(sin theta/lambda)**2 the program derives the scale and B value.</p>

<p>For real structures the assumption that the atoms are randomly distributed
is obviously incorrect. The effect of this is most obvious in the low resolution
reflections. The Wilson plot will deviate from a straight line from about
3.0A - 4.0A downwards. Although all the points on the Wilson plot are
plotted, the scale and B are only determined from a limited resolution range
determined by the user (see keyword <a href="#rscale">RSCALE</a>).</p>

<p>There may be a problem in evaluating &lt;Fobs**2&gt; if all the weak
data have been systematically omitted (this should NOT be the case for
data measured in any proper manner: note that if this IS the case, the
Truncate procedure will also fail). If this is the case then you need to
use TRUNCATE NO. The program estimates the expected number of reflections
in each resolution shell and then calculates &lt;Fobs**2&gt; by dividing
by the number of predicted reflections.</p>

<h2>Errors And Warnings</h2>

<p>The program may stop with the following error message:</p>

<pre>
TRUNCATE:  *** Data beyond useful resolution limit ***
</pre> 

<p>This indicates that there is a resolution bin where the &lt;I&gt; is
&lt;= 0.0 (which indeed is tantamount to having indexed the data beyond
a useful resolution limit).</p>

<p>In this situation it is worth running TRUNCATE again setting the high
resolution limit to something below the current maximum (using the
<a href="#reso">RESO</a> keyword). However it is also worth considering
whether this is an indication of a more serious problem (for example,
is the wrong cell set?).</p>
