<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>

<p><i>program</i> is the name of the CCP4 program being run. This documentation
outlines the general concepts common to running most CCP4 programs. For
specific details of how to run individual programs you are referred to the
specific documentation for those programs.</p>

<a name="input"></a>
<H2>Specifying input and output files</H2>

<p>When running CCP4 programs, input and output data files are normally
specified by associating the file names with the logical names.
Logical names are alphanumeric, and can include underscores.</p>

<p>The usual format of a program invocation is</p>

<pre>
&lt;program name&gt; [ &lt;logical name&gt; &lt;file name&gt; ] ...
</pre>

<p>where "&lt; &gt;" indicates placeholders and "[ ]" indicates optional
repeated items i.e. zero or more occurrences (here and elsewhere in the
documentation).</p>

<p>A concrete example is</p>

<pre>
fft hklin native-Fs.mtz mapout 2Fo-Fc.map
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Logical names are case-insensitive
<li>Each standard logical name has a default extension associated with it
</ul>

<p>File extensions are optional and if omitted default values will be used.
Some common logical names with default extensions are</p>

<table noborder>
<tr><td><b>HKLIN</b></td><td>input MTZ reflection file (.mtz)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>HLKOUT</b></td><td>output MTZ reflection file (.mtz)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>MAPIN</b></td><td>input map file (.map)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>MAPOUT</b></td><td>output map file (.map)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>XYZIN</b></td><td>input coordinate file (.pdb)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>XYZOUT</b></td><td>output coordinate file (.pdb)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In some cases more than one file corresponding to the same type of
entry in $CINCL/default.def is required e.g., several input reflection
files. In this case they are typically specified as
<tt>HKLIN</tt><i>n</i>, for instance, where <i>n</i> is a sequence number.
The rules for matching logical names with the default specifications
given above then apply to the prefix of the name which matches the
entries in the files $CINCL/environ.def and $CINCL/default.def.</p>

<p>(For information on default.def and environ.def, see the section on
<a href="#details">details of logical name processing</a>.)</p>

<p>Input files that do not exist are reported and the program stops
processing. Output files that already exist will also cause the program to
stop unless the environment variable <b>CCP4_OPEN</b> is set to `UNKNOWN',
when they will be truncated to zero, overwritten and a warning message
displayed.</p>

<p>Some file extensions are also treated as special cases and if you use them
then you may experience unexpected behaviour - see the section on
<a href="#warnings">warnings</a>.</p>

<a name="keywords"></a>
<H2>Keyworded input</H2>

<p>Most CCP4 programs take `keyworded' input to set their parameters.</p>

<p>These have a leading keyword followed, possibly, by arguments which might be
numbers or strings or keyword/value pairs of the form</p>
 
<p><I>keyword</I><B>=</B><I>value.</I></p>

<p>Such arguments are separated by spaces, tabs, commas or `=' characters. 
The details of the input expected is given in the documentation for each program,
however there are some general rules:

<ul>
<li>Only the first four characters of keywords are significant (although you
are recommended to use complete keywords) and they are case-insensitive.

<li>Records may be continued across line breaks using <b>&amp;</b>,
<b>-</b> or <b>/</b> as the last non-blank, non-comment character on the line
to be continued.

<li>Text following a non-quoted <b>!</b> or <b>#</b> is treated as a comment
and ignored.  A continuation character may precede the comment.

<li>Strings may be single- or double-quoted or unquoted if they don't contain
any delimiter characters mentioned above or if the whole of the rest of the
record is read as a single string.

<li>Leading spaces are ignored.

<li>If an input record is of the form <tt>@</tt><i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>, with
possible surrounding whitespace, the contents of the file <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i>
will be included as input at that point, after which the following records will
be read.
</ul>

<a name="options"></a>
<H2>Command line options</H2>
<dl>
<dt> -n<dd>
Do <i>not</i> read the global files <b>default.def</b> and
<B>environ.def</B>.
<dt> -v level<dd>
Verbose output; the amount depends on the value of <i>level</i>, 
which may have a value between 0 and 9, higher values giving more information.
This mainly affects output from the CCP4 library routines.
The <i>Logical_name</i> / <i>File_name </i>
assignments are displayed as they are processed along with other debug
information.  The default value is 1. Choose 0 if you want to suppress
some output, or 2 or higher if you want extra output.
<dt> -d file<dd>
Use the next argument to specify an alternative to the <b>default.def</b>
file.
<dt> -e file<dd>
Use the next argument to specify an alternative to the <b>environ.def</b>
file.
<dt> -i<dd>
Print CCP4 library version, program name and program version to
standard output, and exit.
<dt> -nohtml<dd>
Suppresses the writing of HTML tags in the program output. This is
an alternative to setting the CCP_SUPPRESS_HTML environment variable.
<dt> -nosummary<dd>
Suppresses the writing of summary tags in the program output. This
is an alternative to setting the CCP_SUPPRESS_SUMMARY environment
variable.
</dl>

<a name="details"></a>
<H2>Appendix: Details of logical name processing</H2>

<p><i>[The gory details in this section can be skipped by casual users.]</i></p>

<p>The programs normally read two initialisation files (held in the directory
pointed to by environment variable <b>CINCL</b>):

<ul>
<li>First the file <b>environ.def</b> is read - this specifies the logical
names that can be expected and some information about the type of file
associated with each logical name.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Then <b>default.def</b> is read, which specifies some common logical names
defined for all CCP4 processes, and the corresponding file names (whose path
defaults to the value of environment variable <b>CLIBD </b>).

<p>The logical names actually correspond variables in the program's
environment; the values defined in <b>default.def</b> don't override existing
values of the environment variables corresponding to the relevant logical names,
so defaults may be set by the shell's environment which a program inherits
(e.g. with <b>setenv</b> in <b>csh</b>, or the Bourne shell assignment and
export mechanism).
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Finally the command line arguments are parsed so that the user can override
the defaults on the command line. Thus the value of logical name <b>FOO</b>
will come from the following sources in order of precedence:

<p><ol>
<li>The command line, e.g.:<br>
<i>program</i> <b>foo ...</b> <i>value ...</i>

<li>The environment, e.g. (C shell):<br>
<b>setenv FOO</b> <I>value</I><B>   # NOT using set</B><br>
or Bourne shell:<br>
<B>FOO=</B><I>value</I><B>; export FOO</B>
<li>
Values from
<B>default.def</B>.
</ol>

<p>If a logical name hasn't been defined when a program tries to use it,
e.g. by opening <b>HKLIN</b>, the name of the variable will be used as its
value if it is meant to define a file.</p>

</ul>

<p>These steps are performed by the CCP4 preprocessor functions
<tt>CCPFYP</tt> and <tt>ccp4fyp</tt> (for Fortran and C programs respectively).
For more information on these, see the documentation for
<a href="ccplib.html">CCPLIB</a>.</p>

<a name="examples"></a>
<H2> EXAMPLES</H2>
<blockquote>
<pre>
f2mtz hklin xylose.hkl hklout xylose.mtz &lt;&lt;EOF
SYMMETRY 152
LABOUT H   K  L   F  SIGF   FreeRflag 
CTYPE  H   H  H   F  Q      X 
 ...
EOF
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, if the keywords are in the file <b>keywords</b>
then it is possible to simply use:</p>

<blockquote>
f2mtz hklin xylose.hkl hklout xylose.mtz &lt;keywords
</blockquote>

<a name="warnings"></a>
<H2> WARNINGS</H2>

<p>If a file name ends in <b>.lib</b>, <b>.bes </b>, <b>.prt </b> or
<b>.dic</b> and is <i>not</i> a full path name (i.e. with the full
directory specified in front of the file name, such as ./foo.bar or
/foo/bar.baz) then the environment variable <tt>$CLIBD</tt> will be
prepended to the file name. This can cause files to be written
in an unexpected directory.</p>

<p>A solution is to write (say) <b>SYMOP ./my_symop.lib</b>, or to use
a different extension.</p>

<p>If a file name ends in <b>.scr</b>, and is <i>not</i> the full path
name then the environment variable <tt>$CCP4_SCRATCH</tt> will be
prepended to the file name. The extension <b>scr</b> will <i>in all cases</i>
be replaced by the process number to give the file a (reasonably) distinct
name.</p>
