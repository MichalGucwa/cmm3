<H1> ACT (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>act </b>
- analyse coordinates.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>act xyzin </b>
<i>xyz_in.pdb</i>
<br>
 [<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>]
<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>
The program does some useful coordinate analyses.
For example it quickly finds ALL the crystal contacts,
no matter where the molecule is placed with respect to the origin
(otherwise the fast algorithm for finding contacts is the same
as in Tadeusz Skarzynski's program CONTACT).
<P> 
The program always gives statistics for the temperature factors
averaged by residue, for the main chain and side chains.
<P> 
Lists atoms with B-values .gt. bmoni (default = 50).
<P> 
Lists B-values for Ox1 and Nx2 atoms for each ASN and GLN
- if the difference is large the atoms could be wrong way round.
<P> 
Prints a histogram of solvent molecules in ranges of B-values.
<P> 
Calculates F000 (the number of electrons in the unit cell).
<P> 
The optional output includes various contact analyses.
<H2> <A NAME="keywords"></A>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>
The various data control lines are identified by keywords.
Only the first 4 letters of each keyword are necessary.

[COMPULSORY INPUT]
<H3> <A NAME="contact"></A>CONTACT &lt;keyword&gt; [&lt;dmin&gt;] &lt;dmax&gt;</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<pre>

Listing of contacts

   Keywords:
            ALL (default)
            INTERmolecular
            INTRAmolecular

            dmin dmax - distance limits for listing contacts,
                        in any order (default = 0.0, 5.0).
                        If only one value given it is assumed 
                        to be dmax.

</pre>
<H3> <A NAME="short"></A>SHORT &lt;dmoni&gt;</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<P> 
Listing of short contacts
<P> 
dmoni (default = 2.5) short contacts, up to dmoni, are listed.

<H3> <A NAME="hbond"></A>HBOND &lt;keyword&gt; &lt;hdmin&gt; &lt;hdmax&gt;</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<p>
Listing of possible hydrogen bonds (by distance criterion). 
&lt;keyword&gt; is one of:
<pre>
            ALL (default)
            INTERmolecular
            INTRAmolecular
</pre>
&lt;hdmin&gt; &lt;hdmax&gt; (in any order) are the distance limits for 
listing contacts (default = 2.7, 3.3). A list of unpaired hydrogen bonding 
atoms is given with HBOND ALL option.
<p>
HBOND looks for contacts between oxygen and nitrogen atoms. An earlier
version of <tt>act</tt> excluded various N/O and O/O combinations, but
this was causing genuine hydrogen bonds to be missed. The current version
makes no such exclusions, and therefore will list many false positives.
<p>
In any case, <tt>act</tt> uses a simple distance criterion. From the list
generated, you should check:
<ol>
<li>protonation: does one atom act as donor and one as acceptor? This may
depend on a wider hydrogen-bonding network
<li>angles: are the bonded-donor-acceptor and donor-acceptor-bonded angles
acceptable?
</ol>

<H3> <A NAME="bmonitor"></A>BMONITOR &lt;bmoni&gt;</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<P> 
Monitor B-values greater than bmoni (default = 50.0).
<H3> <A NAME="bdump"></A>BDUMP</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<P> 
Dump ascii plot files (BRES.PLT) for the B-factors to disk
<H3> <A NAME="sequ"></A>SEQU</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<P> 
Extract sequence and analyse the amino acid composition.
<H3><a name="end">END</a></H3>
[COMPULSORY INPUT]
<P> 
last card, ends input.
<H2> <A NAME="note"></A>NOTE</H2>
PLOTTING:
<P> 
If NAG graphics library is available:
Uncomment the call to plotit and the ACTPLOT code and link with
the library.  You can then plot B-values by residue with 
keyword:
<H3> <A NAME="bplt"></A>BPLT</H3>
[OPTIONAL INPUT]
<P> 
Plot B-values by residue with NAG graphics library
<H2> <A NAME="files"></A>INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
The input files are:
<ol>
 <li>Control data file
 <li>Input coordinate file in PDB format
</ol>
The output files are:
<ol>
 <li>Listing of program output to the printer.
 <li>BRES.PLT ascii plot file for the B-factors, if BDUMP keyword was read.
</ol>
<H2> <A NAME="printer_output"></A>PRINTER OUTPUT</H2>
The printer output starts with F000 (the number of electrons in the unit cell),
the number of amino acid residues, solvent molecules, metal and other atoms
in the input file.
<P> 
The program then outputs analysis of the temperature factors by residue
for main chain and side chains. For each chain a table is printed for
the distribution of residues in ranges of standard deviation of the B-values.
The residues with temperature factor greater than three standard deviations
from the average value are listed. This analysis is done for main chain
and side chain atoms for each chain separately.
<P> 
A list is given of atoms with B-values greater than bmoni, if input,
or 50 by default.
<P> 
Next follows a list of B-values for the oxygens and nitrogens of the amide
groups of glutamines and asparagines. This can be used as a check if those
atoms are placed the wrong way round - the difference would then be large.
<P> 
At the end of the 'compulsory' output a histogram of the solvent molecules
is given in ranges of temperature factors
<P> 
For the contact searching options pairs of atoms are listed and the distance
between then. If the contact is with a symmetry related atom the number
of NSYM symmetry operation is given for that atom followed by the number
of translations of whole unit cell along x, y and z.
<P> 
For the HBOND ALL option a list of unpaired hydrogen bonding atoms is given.
For well refined structures the atoms with hydrogen bonding potential
should normally make a bond, perhaps with the exception of main chain
nitrogens of prolines.
<P> 
For SEQU option the sequence is extracted from the input file and listed
for each chain in both the three-letter and one letter notations.
Next the amino acid composition is listed followed by a histogram.
