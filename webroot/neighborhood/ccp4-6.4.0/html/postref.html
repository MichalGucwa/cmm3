<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
This program refines orientation and cell parameters for one
or more rotation film packs, by comparing the intensities of
partial reflections with a reference intensity.
<H2> KEY WORDED INPUT </H2>
Most cards are optional (except BATCH), and all are free format,
with fields separated by 'space'. Cards may be in any order, except
for BATCH and END. Any keyword may be abbreviated to 4 letters, and
they are case-insensitive. Data for any card may be continued if
necessary on the next line, by the character '-' or '&' at the end
of the line.
<P> 
The following keywords are available
<pre>

</pre>
<H3> TITLE  title</H3>
Title to write to printer output.
<H3> ROCK  keyword(s)</H3>
Rocking curve keywords are STEP, COSINE  (default)  or  TANH  for
square profile, cosine profile,  or  hyperbolic  tangent  profile
respectively,  and  ISOTROPIC  (default)   or   ANISOTROPIC   for
isotropic or anisotropic divergence refinement. If present, STEP,
COSINE or TANH must precede ISOTROPIC or ANISOTROPIC.
<P> 
ISOTROPIC is equivalent to 
<pre>
     FREE ET
     FIX  DH DV DL CD
</pre>
ANISOTROPIC is equivalent to
<pre> 
     FREE DH DV
     FIX  ET DL CD
</pre>
<P> 
For the tanh profile, the TANH keyword may  be  followed  by  the
keyword WTANH (alias LIMIT) and a value for the truncation  limit
WTANH ( = w in section following expression (c) above)  which  is
used to make the tanh function into  a  bounded  curve;  and  the
keyword QTANH (alias SCALE) may be followed by a scale factor for
the argument of the tanh function ( = q in expression (c) above):
the refined value of the reflection width or divergence  will  be
dependent on the value of w/q, since as w is increased,  more  of
the tail of the profile is included in the reflection width.  The
default value of w = WTANH = 2.7 ( tanh(2.7)  =  0.991  ),  which
means that the curve is truncated at Pcal =  0.0045  and  Pcal  =
0.9955. The default value of q = QTANH = 2.0
<H3> MOSAICITY &lt;eta&gt;</H3>
Specify crystal mosaicity eta (degrees) to override value in file
<H3> BEAM   [FILE] | [&lt;DH&gt;  &lt;DV&gt;  &lt;DL&gt; &lt;CD&gt;]</H3>
Define beam parameters to override values in file.
<P> 
If the keyword FILE is given, the beam parameters and mosaicity
will be picked up from the input file (from OSCGEN and
ABSCALE) (this the default).
<dl>
<dt> DH<dd>
horizontal beam divergence (degrees)
<dt> DV <dd>
vertical beam divergence (degrees)
<dt> DL <dd>
delta(lambda)/lambda = dispersion
<dt> CD <dd>
correlated component of the spectral dispersion
</dl>
<H3> FIX or FREE followed by labels</H3>
Specifies which parameters are to  be  refined.  The  2-character
parameter labels are:
<pre>
          A*, B*, C*   cell edges
 
          AA, BA, GA   cell angles
 
          WL           wavelength
 
          ZM, ZD       mean and difference of epsilon-z
 
          YM, YD       mean and difference of epsilon-y
 
          ET           mosaicity (eta)
 
          DH, DV       horizontal, vertical beam divergence

          DL           dispersion, delta lambda/lambda (leave fixed)

          CD           correlated dispersion (leave fixed)
</pre> 
The keywords FIX or FREE may be mixed with parameter labels to
specify the status of subsequent parameters given on the card.
<P>  
Defaults: cell parameters normally default to the flags given in
the orientation block, but if any cell parameter label is given
here, all the cell parameters will default to free. The cell
flags in the file also indicate constraints tying cell edges
together (eg a* = b* ): these constraints are not affected by FIX
or FREE cards. Other parameters are by default fixed except for
ZM, YM and ET (or DH & DV if the divergence is anisotropic:
a ROCK ... ANISOTROPIC card sets DH & DV free and fixes ET).
If WL is free, the cell edges A*, B* and C* are automatically fixed. 
You would be ill-advised (probably) to refine beam
parameters other than ET or DH+DV.
<H3> DELAY  label  delay ....</H3>
This card takes a series of pairs  of  parameter-label,  'LABEL',
(see FIX card) and a number DELAY,  which  makes  that  parameter
fixed for the first DELAY cycles, after which it reverts  to  its
status as defined by FIX and FREE cards.  All  delays  default  to
zero.
<H3> CONSTRAINT  icon(1) ... icon(6)</H3>
Set cell constraint flags to  override  those  derived  from  the
input file. If ICON(I) =  J, the I'th cell dimension is
constrained to equal the J'th: normal values are 1 2 3 4 5 6 .
<H3> REFINE  ncyc  convrg   fltlim   fltstt  fltdec</H3>
NCYC is the number of cycles (defaults to 8).
<P>  
CONVRG is a convergence limit (default =  0.02);  the  refinement
has converged if the change of SIG = Sqrt ( Sum ( w del**2 ) )  /
(Nobs - Npar) is less than CONVRG.
<P>  
FLTLIM, FLTSTT, FLTDEC. The filter-level is the amount  added  to
all eigenvalues to  speed  convergence:  it  has  the  effect  of
damping  shifts  in  the  directions   corresponding   to   small
eigenvalues.  The  filter  level  starts  at   FLTSTT,   and   is
decremented  by  FLTDEC  until  it   reaches   FLTLIM   (defaults
0.0,0.05,0.02)
<H3> REJECT  fincr rejfac(1) rejfac(2) cutoff rejang frlow frdec rejsd frclim</H3>
Reflection rejection limits etc.
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> FINCR     <dd>
Intensity  increment  for  analysis  against  intensity
(default = 1000).  Used  only  when  PRINT  is  set  to
ANALYSIS or FULL. Max. no. of bins fixed at 12.
<dt> REJFAC(1) <dd>
reject reflections with Iobs  &lt;  REJFAC(1)  *  sd(Iobs)
(default = 0) The refinement  seems  to  converge  best
with all data included.
<dt> REJFAC(2) <dd>
reject reflections with Iref  &lt;  REJFAC(2)  *  sd(Iref)
(default = 0)
<dt> CUTOFF    <dd>
reject  reflections  with  sd(fraction  obs)  &gt;  CUTOFF
(default=0.5)
<dt> REJANG    <dd>
reject reflection closer than  REJANG  degrees  to  the
rotation axis on the film (default = 3 degrees)
<dt> FRLOW,FRDEC <dd>
define which non-fractional reflections are used.  In
each  cycle,  reflections  are  used  with   calculated
fraction Pcal such that
<pre>
         -FRL &lt; Pcal &lt; 1 + FRL
</pre> 
FRL  starts  at  FRLOW  on  the  first  cycle,  and  is
decremented by FRDEC on each cycle  until  FRL  =  0.0.
This allows reflections  which  are  just  outside  the
fractional range to be used in  the  early  cycles,  in
case they are really fractional. These reflections  are
weighted by
<pre> 
      (1 - exp( - (delta I)**2/2(sd(I))**2 ) )
</pre> 
to weight  down  those  reflections  which  are  really
non-fractional. (Defaults 0.0, 0.0)
<dt> REJSD     <dd>
reject reflections for which   Pobs - Pcal   &gt; REJSD  *
sd(Pobs) (default = 10.0)
<dt> FRCLIM    <dd>
omit reflections altogether  from  calculation  if  the
calculated fraction in the input file  FRACTIONCALC  is
greater than FRCLIM.  If  this  fraction  is  reliable,
leaving out the safe fully recorded reflections  speeds
up the calculation considerably.
</dl>
</blockquote> 
<H3> REFMEAN</H3>
Use mean of safe fully recorded reflections (IMEAN) as  reference
intensity (default, cards REFSUM and REFALL are alternatives).
<H3> REFSUM</H3>
Use summed partials (ISUM) as reference intensity.
<H3> REFALL</H3>
Use summed partials (ISUM) as reference intensity if present,
otherwise IMEAN
<H3> RESOLUTION  res1 [res2]</H3>
RES1,RES2. Set resolution limits in Angstrom,  either  order.  If
only one number given, use as high resolution limit. Default, use
all data.
<H3> SDFAC  sdfac  sdadd</H3>
Read modification factors for standard deviation of Iobs, as  for
ROTAVATA and AGROVATA.
<P>  
Variance(Iobs):= SDFAC**2 ( Var(Iobs) + (SDADD * Iobs)**2 )
<P>  
(Default 1.0, 0.0 ie no change)
<H3> CELL  a  b  c  [alpha  beta  gamma]</H3>
Read real cell dimensions  (Angstrom  and  degrees)  to  override
those on the file. Angles default to 90. This needs to be repeated 
for each CRYSTAL card.
<H3> WAVELENGTH  wavelength</H3>
WAVELENGTH is the wavelength in Angstrom  to  override  value  in
file. If this  card  is  present  but  no  value  is  given,  the
wavelength is set to 1.54182 (Cu Kalpha). This needs to be repeated 
for each CRYSTAL card.
<H3> MISSET  phix  phiy  phiz  [phix2  phiy2  phiz2]</H3>
Read mis-setting angles (degrees) to override those in the  file.
Two  different  sets  of   three   angles   may   be   specified,
corresponding to the start and finish of the rotation range (phi1
and phi2). By default, the two sets  are  equal  (ie  no  crystal
slippage). This needs to be repeated for each CRYSTAL card.
<H3> SCALE  scale  bfac</H3>
Read scale and temperature factor for the next batch, to override
the values in the file. If this card is present, the  next  BATCH
card must specify one batch only.
<H3> OUTPUT  [keyword]</H3>
The keyword OFF switches off output of reflections to the  output
MTZ file. The keyword ALL makes the program copy all  batches  to
the output file, even if they are not  refined.  An  OUTPUT  card
with no keyword resets the default option, to write to the output
file only those batches which are refined.
<H3> INSCALE  [keyword]</H3>
By default, a scale correction is applied if a column SCALE is present
in the file. The INSCALE card switches the application of this scale
off or on again. Keywords OFF or ON may be present, otherwise the card
switches to the opposite state
<H3> PRINT  keyword</H3>
Set amount of analysis etc printed.  The optional keywords are:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> BRIEF     <dd>
(default) minimal  output,  prints  only  the  analysis
against fraction
<dt> SHIFTS    <dd>
(or PRINT with no keyword) prints also  the  shifts  on
EACH cycle and the orientation  data  from  the  header
records for each batch.
<dt> ANALYSIS  <dd>
additional extensive  analysis  after  the  last  cycle
(this is worth doing for at least a few films).
<dt> FULL      <dd>
is equivalent to both SHIFTS and ANALYSIS
<dt> REFLECTIONS <dd>
in addition to the FULL analysis, all reflections are
printed on the last cycle.
<dt> VECTORS   <dd>
prints eigenvectors of normal matrix on last cycle,  as
well as eigenvalues.
</dl>
</blockquote> 
<H3> DEBUG  ibug</H3>
Set debug flag to give extensive (!) output for debugging.
<H3> BATCH   [ batch-specification ]</H3>
This card is an alternative to the CRYSTAL card, specifies  which
batches are to be refined as independent films, and refines them.
Note that unlike other cards which specify parameters  or  flags,
the BATCH card tells the program to refine the specified batches,
after which further cards  are  read  to  change  parameters  and
refine more batches if required. Batches must always be specified
in the order they occur in the file, ie  in  ascending  order  of
batch number.
<P>  
Specification of batches
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> (a) <dd>
ALL all batches (default if no keyword on BATCH card)
<dt> (b) <dd>
list of batches  n1 n2 n3 etc
<dt> (c) <dd>
range of batches  n1 TO n2
<dt> (d) <dd>
EXCLUDE with list n1 n2 n3 etc  This  may  follow  ALL  or  a
range.
</dl>
</blockquote> 
<H3> CRYSTAL   [keywords]     batch-specification</H3>
This card is an alternative to BATCH, and specifies  a  group  of
films to be refined together (up to 50). The batch specifications
are the same as for  the  BATCH  card.  By  default,  mis-setting
angles and rocking curve parameters are refined independently for
each  film.  The  keyword  ONEMISSET  causes  the  same  set   of
mis-setting angles to be refined for all files, and  the  keyword
ONEROCK the same set of rocking curve parameters.  Both  keywords
may be present. Note that the ONEMISSET option will not work well
with a set of films covering a large rotation angle, since the 
refinement of mis-setting within each cycle is done in the camera
frame rather than the crystal frame.
<H3> END</H3>
This terminates the program. Alternatively, the program  ends  on
end-of-file on  stream  5.  If  OUTPUT  ALL  was  specified,  any
remaining unrefined batches in the file are copied to the  output
file.

<H2> PROGRAM FUNCTION</H2>
This program is based on the post-refinement program  by  Winkler  and
Schutt (ref. 1). It refines orientation and cell parameters for one or more
rotation film packs, by comparing the intensities  of  partial  reflections
with a reference intensity. The reference intensity is typically  the  mean
of safe fully recorded reflections from the same or different films, or the
sum of the spot with its  other  half.  The  reference  intensity  and  the
appropriate scale factor may be provided by the program ROTAVATA.
<P> 
The residual minimized is
<pre>

           Sum w ( Iobs - Pcal Iref )**2

</pre> 
where the calculated fraction Pcal is  a  function  of  the  following
parameters:
<blockquote>
Cell dimensions
<P> 
Wavelength (as an alternative to cell edges)
<P> 
Misorientation  angles  phi-z,  phi-y,  phi-x  (optionally
different at the two ends of the rotation  range).  Within
each cycle the program refines the mis-setting  angles  in
the camera frame epsilon-z and epsilon-y (ZM and YM),  and
optionally their difference ZD and YD,  then  rotates  the
epsilon shifts into the  reference  frame  (phi-z,  phi-y,
phi-x ) after each cycle.
<P>  
Rocking curve parameters (divergence and dispersion)
</blockquote>
The program may refine each film pack (batch) separately,  or  a  group  of
films (up to 50) may be refined together with  the  same  cell  dimensions,
with the same or different mis-setting angles and rocking curve  parameters
(see CRYSTAL card).
<P>  
The program allows three alternative forms of rocking curve to  relate  the
angular fraction to the intensity fraction:  both  have  a  finite  angular
width 2g, such that the intensity fraction
<pre>

          Pcal = 1/2 ( 1 +- f(b) )

</pre> 
where b is the angular fraction (ie fraction of g) = delta beta / g
<pre>

      (a) square profile   f(b) = b
 
      (b) cosine profile   f(b) = sin ( b * pi/2 )
 
      (c) hyperbolic tangent profile f(b) = tanh ( q * b )
 
          where q = QTANH is a scale for the tanh function (see ROCK card).
 
</pre> 
Note that function (b) is defined only for -1 &lt; b &lt; 1 and  (c)  for   b   &lt;
(w/q): otherwise function (a) is used. The tanh function (c) is  equivalent
to a peak with tails compared to the cosine function. For the tanh profile,
b = (w/q)*(delta beta / g ), and b is truncated at  b  = w/q : w = WTANH is
the truncation limit (see ROCK card). This scaling ( parameters w and  q  )
makes the divergence for the tanh function more comparable  with  that  for
the cosine curve.
<P> 
The reflection width g includes a dispersion term, and may be anisotropic.
<pre>
 
   g = 1/2 * ( sqrt( (2  TANtheta  *  CD  +  DH  COSalpha)**2  +  (DV  *
       SINalpha)**2) + ET + DL * TANtheta )

</pre> 
see Greenhough & Helliwell (ref. 2) and Greenhough (ref. 3) (see BEAM card)
where alpha = (tan)**-1 y/z , the azimuthal angle  on  the  film. 
Note that g is the half-width of  the  reflection,  but  the  rocking-curve
parameters ET, DH & DV refer to  the  full-width  of  the reflection.
<H3> A note on convergence</H3>
If the program is  refining  parameters  for  one  film  at  a  time,  some
parameters are poorly determined. This may not be too serious, since we are
not interested in the parameters themselves, but only in the  fractionality
calculated for each reflection from  the  parameters.  In  particular,  the
mis-setting angle about the rotation axis phi-z (epsilon-z)  is  correlated
with the cell dimensions perpendicular to the rotation  axis.  Cell  angles
are even more correlated, and it is doubtful whether  cell  angles  can  be
refined sensibly with only one film. The program has three facilities which
may assist convergence.
<dl>
<dt> a)  <dd>
Eigenvalue filtering (see REFINE card)
<br>
A number (filter) may be added to all eigenvalues of the  normal
matrix during the calculation of shifts. This is  equivalent  to
adding the filter value to all diagonal elements of  the  normal
matrix (Marquardt method), and has the effect of damping  shifts
in the direction corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues.  The
filtering seems useful on the first few  cycles,  to  allow  the
most sensitive parameters  to  refine  first,  but  it  is  best
decremented to zero after 3 or 4  cycles  (as  is  done  in  the
default settings).
<dt> b)  <dd>
Parameter delay (see DELAY card)
<br>
Any parameter may be fixed for the first few cycles. This may be
useful for the parameters ZD and YD, which define the difference
of orientation at the beginning and end of the rotation range.
<dt> c)  <dd>
Inclusion of reflections which are not partial, but  are  nearly
so. (parameters FRLOW and FRDEC on REJECT card)
<br>
It is possible to include reflections bordering on the partial in the early
cycles, since they may become partial as the parameters change. This  seems
not to be helpful, but may be in some cases
</dl>
<H3> Details of input reflection file</H3>
The input MTZ file may be prepared by ROTAVATA and SORTMTZ. It  contains  a
series of  films  (batches)  which  are  processed  sequentially,  although
individual batches may be selected for inclusion  or  exclusion.  The  file
must be sorted with BATCH as the most significant key. The file is expected
to contain columns
<pre>
H K L M/ISYM BATCH I SIGI FRACTIONCALC IMEAN SIGIMEAN ISUM SIGISUM
</pre>
where IMEAN and ISUM are alternative  reference  intensities,  respectively
the mean of the safe fully recorded reflections, and the  sum  of  the  two
adjacent partials.
<P> 
The file should also a batch header and orientation block for each
batch.  The orientation block contains starting values of the
orientation parameters, constraint flags for cell parameters, and the
relative scale and temperature factor (from ROTAVATA) to put this
batch on the same scale as the reference intensity. The orientation
blocks are put into the file by ABSCALE. The orientation parameters in
the file may be overridden by control data (see above).
<P> 
Orientation data (see also libmtz.doc)
<pre>

       1.  6 cell dimensions (Angstrom and degrees,  real  numbers).  These
           cell dimensions define an orthogonalization matrix B to  convert
           indices hkl to Cartesian crystal axes xyz
 
           x  =  B  h
 
           B = (a*        b* cos gamma*    c* cos beta*            )
               (0         b* sin gamma*   -c* sin beta* cos alpha  )
               (0               0             lambda / c           )

                                               (Busing & Levy 1967)
 
           This gives x parallel to a*, and y in the a* b* plane.
 
       2.  6 cell dimension flags (integer) defining which parameters may
           be varied.
 
               Flag = -1       parameter is freely variable
 
                    =  0       parameter is fixed (ie cell angle  =  90  or
                               120)
 
                    = I(.gt.0) parameter is constrained to  have  the  same
                                value as parameter number I .
 
       3.  Orthonormal matrix U (9 real numbers in order U11, U12, U13, U21
           etc) to rotate the crystal Cartesian coordinates to  the  camera
           Cartesian coordinates. The IDXREF matrix is A = U B . The matrix
           U defines a standard orientation,  and  is  a  function  of  the
           mounting axis and the axis defined as phi = 0 , but  it  is  not
           dependent on the misorientation angles. Typically, U will  be  a
           permutation matrix.
 
       4.  JUMPAX, the 'mounting' axis, as defined for  OSCGEN  (1,2,3  for
           h,k,l) (not used)
 
       5.  6 misorientation angles, rotation  axis  mis-setting  (6
           real numbers):
 
                 PHIX1 , PHIY1 , PHIZ1 , PHIX2 , PHIY2 , PHIZ2 
 
           The first three refer to the orientation at the beginning of the
           rotation range (at phistart), the second three  phi  angles  (if
           present) refer to the end of the rotation range (at  phiend).
           The second set should be set  equal  to  the  first  set  if  no
           crystal slippage is assumed.
 
       6.  Start and stop rotation angles.  (  2  real  numbers)  phistart,
           phiend
 
       7.  crystal mosaicity in degrees 
 
       8.  lambda, delta lambda/lambda, correlated dispersion
 
       9.  Scale, Temperature factors for this batch ( from Rotavata etc).
           The correction to be applied is
 
                 SC * exp ( -2 * B * (sin theta/lambda)**2 )

<H3> Details of output reflection file</H3>
The output MTZ file is similar in structure to the input file. The  refined
orientation parameters are  placed  in  the  orientation  block.  For  each
reflection, the calculated fraction and its standard deviation  are  placed
in columns labelled FRACTIONCALC and SIGFRACTCALC, and the partial  flag  M
is updated (in column M/ISYM). Valid values of M are:
<pre>

                   M = 0  fully recorded
 
                     = 1  partial ( 0  =&lt; P &lt; 1.0 )
 
                     = 2  not recorded ( P &lt; 0 )
 
                     = 3  partial at both ends of the range
 
                     = 4  too near axis (see REJANG above on REJECT) card

</pre> 
Reflections with M &gt; 1 will be rejected in AGROVATA.
