<H2> AVERAGING REQUIREMENTS</H2>
In order to perform an averaging calculation you need the following information:
<ol>
<li>Averaging Matrix.<br>
The averaging, or 'RT' operators are a rotation and translation which
describe the mapping between one area of density and another. For 
<a href="dm.html">DM</a>
they can be given as matrices in CCP4 or O format, or as Euler/Polar
angles and translations. They are always given in orthogonal angstrom
coordinates.
<li>Averaging Mask.<br>
This covers the region of the unit cell that obeys the
non-crystallographic symmetry. Note that it does not cover a unit cell
or an asymmetric unit, it does not obey the cell repeat, and it does
not obey the crystallographic symmetry. It is fundamentally different
from a solvent mask. If you do not understand this you had better go
back to the textbooks, or hope that the 'automask' facility works
right first time.
</ol>

<H2> MAKING AVERAGING MATRICES</H2>
The most likely place to find your averaging operators is from running
a self-rotation and translation function, typically in 
<a href="amore.html">AMORE</a>. This will give the operator you 
need in Euler angles, which may be used in DM.
<P> 
You must get the matrices the right way round. For example, if you
calculate a matrix which maps an A chain onto a B chain, then the
averaging mask must cover the volume occupied by the A chain.
<P> 
Alternatively you can make your averaging matrices if you can build
some corresponding fragments of structure in symmetry related
molecules. Heavy atom coordinates can also be used in the
determination of averaging matrices, especially if the rotation
function has been solved. In this case you will need to run a program
such as <a href="lsqkab.html">LSQKAB</a>.

<H2> MAKING AVERAGING MATRICES USING LSQKAB</H2>
You can use the program LSQKAB from the CCP4 library to calculate the
matrices relating one set of atoms to another. See the documentation
of that program to find out more about writing the command script. Here
is an example script which will find the matrix to map 125 residues
from chain B onto chain A. You could also match e.g. chain A in one pdb
file to another chain A in a different file.
<pre>

lsqkab                   
     REFRCD chmi.pdb \  
     WORKCD chmi.pdb \ 
     LSQOP  junk.pdb \
  &lt;&lt; 'END-lsqkab'
OUTPUT  XYZ
FIT  WRESIDU MAIN 2 TO 126 WCHAIN B
MATCH RRESIDU 2 TO 126 RCHAIN A
END
'END-lsqkab'

</pre>
The output of this run included the following information:
<pre>

          SUM DISPLACEMENTS**2 =  78.070
          SQRT(SUM DISPLACEMENTS**2)=   0.395
          AVERAGE DISPLACEMENT =   0.236
          MAXIMUM DISPLACEMENT =   5.001

           -0.64432 -0.71551 -0.26998

</pre>
The small average displacement is a good indication that a correct
match has been found. The symmetry operators may then be input to
DM, either as matrices using the ROTA MATRIX and TRANS cards, or as
angles and translations. Alternatively, the matrix may be transposed
and input in O/RAVE format.
<P> 
Thus in this case, the 'AVER' card in the DM command file was as
follows (note that a second run of LSQKAB was used to determine the
third symmetry, between chains A and C):

<H2> Making Averaging Masks</H2>
The easiest way to make an averaging mask is to let DM generate one
by its built in local-correlation-masking code. However even this
requires some thought. The program must pick a correlation cutoff to
isolate the correct masked volume, so it needs to know how much of the
map will agree with a rotated copy of itself. This is achieved with the
'NCSMASK NMER &lt;nmer&gt;' card.
<P> 
You need to specify how many monomers will map onto matching density
under the non-crystallographic symmetry transformations. In the
simplest case - purely improper ncs - the answer is 1. In the case of
purely proper ncs (e.g. 3-fold rotation, or 2-2-2 ncs), then it is the
number of monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (3 and 4 in
these cases).
<P> 
More complex cases occur when ncs operators are related to
crystallographic operators, usually to build up larger multimers. For
example, in Insulin there is a 2-fold ncs axis perpendicular to the
crystallographic 3-fold and intersecting it, with the result that the
entire hexamer obeys the noncrystallographic symmetry, so &lt;nmer&gt;=6. If
fact this case is further complicated because neighbouring cells up
and down the c-axis are related onto each other, so the CLIM card must
also be used.
<P> 
Given the complexity of the task, it is often better to make your own
mask. The local-correlation map can also be generated by 
<A HREF=maprot.html>MAPROT</A> and used in conjunction with graphics 
programs, MAPROT, and <A HREF=ncsmask.html>NCSMASK</A>, to generate 
an averaging mask.

<H2> Making a mask from coordinates</H2>
The other common method for generating an averaging mask is from
coordinates or bones. Coordinates are available when the model has
been partly built, or when there is a molecular replacement solution.
<P> 
Bones are generally generated and then pruned in 'O'. The output bones
file can be turned into a pseudo-pdb file using the utility
<A HREF=bones2pdb.html>BONDES2PDB</A>.
<P> 
In either case, the .pdb file can be converted directly into an
averaging mask using the NCSMASK program.
