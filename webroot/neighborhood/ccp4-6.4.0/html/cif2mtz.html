<H2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>CIF2MTZ is a program to convert an mmCIF reflection file
to MTZ format. mmCIF reflection files are typically obtained
from the Protein Data Bank. There are <a href="#examples">examples</a>
below for some representative PDB entries.</P>

<P>In practice, mmCIF reflection files from the PDB can have
a wide variety of data item names and contents. The program
will attempt to identify quantities correctly, but you should
always check the resulting MTZ file. Keywords are provided
to supply missing information or to help the program make
choices.</P>

<P>There are a large number of mmCIF reflection files in the PDB
which contain the PDB coordinate file header as a comment block.
In particular, cell and symmetry information is held as the
CRYST1 line, rather than using the correct mmCIF categories.
The program will therefore look for a CRYST1 line, as well as
the mmCIF categories. If neither are present, then cell and
symmetry information must be provided via keywords.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B> <TT>CIF2MTZ</TT> works with the macromolecular CIF
format "mmCIF" which is substantially different from the original
"CIF" format. The latter is usually used within small molecule
crystallography, but you may come across it with <TT>SHELX</TT>.
Small molecule "CIF" format has a different syntax (i.e. it is
based on DDL1 rather than DDL2) and so cannot easily be read
from <TT>CIF2MTZ</TT>. If you don't know what format a file is
in, look for <TT>_cell.length_a</TT> (with period: mmCIF) or 
<TT>_cell_length_a</TT> (with underscore: CIF).</P>

from the mmCIF file if it is there. The keywords can be used to provide
missing information, or to override existing information.

<P>An MTZ column is output for each mmCIF item found. The default column 
name &lt;program label&gt; is given in the middle column above, but the LABOUT 
keyword can be used to rename these columns.</P>

<P>With the <a href="#anom">ANOMALOUS</a> option, there are additional
columns F(+) SIGF(+) F(-) SIGF(-) which can be renamed by LABOUT.</P>

<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> the mmCIF file may contain alternative labels,
e.g. <tt>_refln.F_meas</tt> rather than <tt>_refln.F_meas_au</tt>. Some
alternative labels will be recognised, see table above. Otherwise
it is sufficient to edit the label name directly in the mmCIF
file to one of the above labels.</P>

<H3> <A NAME="name"></A>NAME PROJECT &lt;pname&gt; CRYSTAL &lt;xname&gt; DATASET &lt;dname&gt;</H3>
[Note that the keywords PNAME &lt;pname&gt;, XNAME &lt;xname&gt; and DNAME &lt;dname&gt;
are also available, but the NAME keyword is preferred.]
<p>
Specify the project, crystal and dataset names for the output MTZ file.
&lt;pname&gt; and &lt;xname&gt; are taken from _entry.id if present in the mmCIF file,
and &lt;dname&gt; is taken from _diffrn.id if present in the mmCIF file.
If the mmCIF file does not contain _entry.id and _diffrn.id, then
it is strongly recommended
that this information is given. Otherwise, the default project, crystal and 
dataset names are "unknown", "unknown" and "unknownddmmyy" respectively.
<p>
The project-name specifies a particular structure solution project, the
crystal name specifies a physical crystal contributing to that project, 
and the dataset-name specifies a particular dataset obtained from that
crystal. All three should be given.

<H3><A name="block"></A>BLOCK &lt;blockname&gt;</H3>

<p>(Optional keyword)<br>
mmCIF-format reflection files contain reflection data in blocks started
by a "data_&lt;blockname&gt;" tag. Generally, a file will only contain a single
block. In some cases, however, there may be several related blocks (e.g. native
data, and additional datasets for phase determination). A specific block
may be converted to MTZ format by specifying its name (including the "data_"
prefix). Without this keyword, cif2mtz will simply convert the first data block.

<H3><A NAME="anom"></A>ANOMALOUS</H3>

<P>(Optional keyword)<br>
If this keyword is given, the program will attempt to recover F(+) and
F(-) columns from hkl / -h-k-l pairs in the input mmCIF file. Any hkl
singletons will be treated as F(+) data. Columns FP/SIGFP will also
be output as mean of the input F(+) and F(-).</P>

<P><b>Warning:</b> this option will work with mmCIF such as are output
by <a href="mtz2various.html">MTZ2VARIOUS</a>, where the -h-k-l reflection
immediately follows the corresponding hkl, and where hkl reflections are
in the CCP4 asymmetric unit. It will fail in other cases. Without the
ANOMALOUS option, all reflections will be passed unchanged to HKLOUT.</P>

<P><b>Note also:</b> this option deals with the case where anomalous pairs
exist as different reflection rows. This is different (and incompatible with) 
the case where anomalous pairs exist as different columns, e.g. _refln.pdbx_F_plus
and _refln.pdbx_F_minus

<H3><A name="status"></A>STATUS XPLO | CCP4 </H3>

<P>(Optional keyword)<br>
The <tt>_refln.status</tt> column (if present) should flag reflections
used for the free-R calculation by 'f', and others by 'o'. Some mmCIF
files use '0' and '1' instead. The program will pick this up automatically,
but needs to know which convention is being used. This keyword can be used
to set the XPLOr convention ('1' if free, '0' otherwise) or the CCP4
convention  ('0' if free, '1' otherwise). The default is XPLOr convention.</P>

<P>This is the convention used in the input mmCIF file. The MTZ file
always adheres to the CCP4 convention.</P>

<H3><A NAME="end"></A>END</H3>
End keyworded input.

<h2><a name="errors"></a>ERROR MESSAGES</h2>

<dl>
<dt>"CCIF signal CCIF_PARTLOOP" / "Attempt to process loop with incomplete loop packet"
<dd>The file should contain a table of reflection data such that the total number of
items is divisible by the number of columns. If the mmCIF file is badly formatted, 
two numbers may run together, reducing the apparent number of data items. This shouldn't
happen with files from the PDB, but may happen after local processing. If you get this
error message, you need to check through the data careful looking for such mistakes.
</dl>

<h2><A NAME="examples"></A>EXAMPLES</h2>

Structure factors and their sigmas from 1gme:
<pre>

cif2mtz hklin r1gmesf.ent hklout 1gme.mtz &lt;&lt;eof
END
eof

</pre>
Another example of diffraction data, this time containing
squared structure factors (assumed to be intensities) and
calculated structure factors. The file only contains
the list of reflections, so additional information must
be supplied:
<pre>

cif2mtz hklin r1d9ysf.ent hklout 1d9y.mtz &lt;&lt;eof
CELL 40.583  111.009  140.423  90.00  90.00  90.00
SYMM C2221
NAME PROJ MBP CRYS apoprotein DATA native
END
eof

</pre>
Finally, 1gr5 contains structure factors and phases from
electron microscopy data:
<pre>

cif2mtz hklin r1gr5sf.ent hklout 1gr5.mtz &lt;&lt;eof
END
eof

</pre>
Note that this file contains dummy cell dimensions and
symmetry, and it may be convenient to set these with
the CELL and SYMM keywords.
