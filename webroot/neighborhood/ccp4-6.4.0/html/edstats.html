- Calculates per-residue real-space electron density R factors,
correlation coefficients, Z(observed) metrics for the
&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> Fourier map and Z(difference) metrics for the
&Delta;&rho; (difference) Fourier; also computes data for the histogram,
and P-P and Q-Q difference plots for the observed and difference Fourier
maps.

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The program <B>EDSTATS</B> calculates real-space electron density R
factors, correlation coefficients, Z<SUB>obs</SUB> and Z<SUB>diff</SUB>
metrics for main- (includes C&beta; atom) and side-chain atoms of
individual residues and/or atoms.&nbsp This integrates and replaces the
functionalities of <A HREF=sfall.html TARGET=_blank>SFALL</A> (MODE
ATMMAP ATMMOD/RESMOD options) and <A HREF=overlapmap.html
TARGET=_blank>OVERLAPMAP</A> (CORRELATE ATOM/RESIDUE options).&nbsp In
addition it recognises the chain ID and the PDB residue label insertion
code (which SFALL ignores!), and so does not require a specification of
the residue label mapping for each chain (CHAIN option in
SFALL/OVERLAPMAP).

<UL>
<P><LI>The real-space R factor (RSR) is defined (Br&#xe4;nd&#xe9;n &
Jones, 1990; Jones <I>et al.</I>, 1991) as:
<P><CENTER>RSR = &Sigma; |&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> - &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB>| /
&Sigma; |&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> + &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB>|</CENTER>

<P><LI>The real-space correlation coefficient (RSCC) is defined as:
<P><CENTER>RSCC = cov(&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>,&rho;<SUB>calc</SUB>) /
sqrt(var(&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>) var(&rho;<SUB>calc</SUB>))</CENTER>
<P>where cov(.,.) and var(.) are the sample covariance and variance
(<I>i.e.</I> calculated with respect to the sample means of
&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> and &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB>).

<P><LI>EDSTATS computes two real-space correlation coefficients: the
'sample' correlation coefficient defined above, and the 'population'
correlation coefficient, <I>i.e.</I> with respect to the population
(overall) means, which will be zero if the F(000) terms were not
included in the map calculation (OVERLAPMAP uses only the sample
means).&nbsp The RSCC based on the population means seems to be better
at detecting weak correlations.

<P><LI>The real-space Z<SUB>obs</SUB> metric (RSZO) is defined (Tickle,
2011) as:
<P><CENTER>RSZO = mean(&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>) / &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;)
</CENTER>
<P>where &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) is the standard uncertainty of the
<B>difference Fourier</B> map.&nbsp Note that this is the standard
uncertainty of the 'Fo-Fc' map, NOT the RMS value of the '2Fo-Fc' map,
which bears no relationship whatsoever to the uncertainty!

<P><LI>The real-space Z<SUB>diff</SUB> metrics (RSZD- and RSZD+) are
defined (Tickle, 2011) as follows for the sets of negative and positive
values respectively of &Delta;&rho; at the grid points that are covered
by the group of main- or side-chain atoms under consideration:

<P>1. Order the values in each set in increasing numerical value
(<I>i.e.</I> ignoring the sign).

<P>2. For each of <I>N</I> subsets of size 1, 2, ..., <I>N</I>-1,
<I>N</I> of the numerically highest values of the original set of size
<I>N</I>, compute the cumulative probability of chi-square
(&chi;<SUP>2</SUP> = &Sigma;
(&Delta;&rho;/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;))<SUP>2</SUP>) for the subset.&nbsp
So the subset of size 1 is simply the numerically highest value
('maximum order statistic') in the original set, the subset of size 2
consists of the 2 highest values of the set, the subset of size
<I>N</I>-1 excludes the lowest value, and the subset of size N is just
the set itself.

<P>3. In practice this &chi;<SUP>2</SUP> cumulative probability is very
difficult to compute (even by stochastic numerical integration) for
subsets other than those of size 1 and <I>N</I> (it involves integrals
up to dimension <I>N</I> where <I>N</I> may be anything from 10 to
1000).&nbsp Note that the standard &chi;<SUP>2</SUP> cumulative
probability assumes that the sample is selected randomly, whereas here
we are selecting the highest values.&nbsp Therefore we approximate it as
the product of two components: the standard cumulative probability of
&chi;<SUP>2</SUP> for a randomly selected subset, and a correction, the
Dunn-&#x160;id&#xe1;k correction (Sokal & Rohlf, 1995; Gibbons &
Chakraborti, 2003), in this case the cumulative probability of the order
statistic, for the fact that we are selecting the highest values.

<P>4. Take the highest cumulative probability over all subsets, and
convert this to the corresponding normal Z-score, making the Z-score
negative for the set of negative values; this is the final RSZD- or
RSZD+ score.&nbsp The program also computes a combined RSZD score which
is simply the maximum of |RSZD-| and RSZD+.

<P><LI>The real-space Z-scores RSZO, RSZD- and RSZD+ require estimates
of the standard uncertainty &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) and offset of the
'Fo-Fc' map (the offset arises from omission of the F(000) term, which
may differ from zero since the model is not necessarily complete).&nbsp
The recommended procedure is to use as an initial estimate the value of
the &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) in the map header, with zero as the offset,
and then rescale &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) and the offset separately for
each chain and the bulk solvent.&nbsp Bulk solvent is assigned the chain
ID '%' for this purpose and ordered waters are considered to belong to a
chain with ID '0' whatever their actual chain IDs in the PDB file.

<P><LI>The sample size correction above arises because the greater the
sample size the more likely it is that high values will occur purely by
chance.&nbsp This correction takes into account the fact that the number
of grid points is not the same for all residues, because obviously
different residue types contain different numbers of atoms, and also
different limiting atom radii will enclose different numbers of grid
points, because the radius varies with atom type and
B<SUB>iso</SUB>.&nbsp The correction is therefore necessary to make the
metrics comparable between different residues and to be able to apply a
common threshold to the metric for all residues.&nbsp Note that the RSR
and RSCC metrics do not apply a sample size correction: it is assumed
that all sample points contribute equally to the metrics independent of
the sample size.

<P><LI>The number of grid points referred to above is the number of
statistically independent grid points covering the atoms; this is the
actual number of grid points with an over-sampling correction
factor.&nbsp According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the grid
spacing required for statistical independence is 1/2 the high resolution
cut-off (<I>d</I><SUB>min</SUB>), so <I>e.g.</I> if a grid spacing of
<I>d</I><SUB>min</SUB>/4 is used then the effective number of grid
points is the actual number / 2<SUP>3</SUP>.

<P><LI>The advantage of the real-space Z-scores over the real-space R
factor and correlation coefficient scores (including the 'population' CC
metric) is that the former depend purely on model accuracy (RSZD) or
model precision (RSZO), whereas RSR and RSCC depend on both
(<I>e.g.</I> it's obvious from the plots that RSR and RSCC are at least
partially correlated with the atomic B<SUB>iso</SUB>s); this means that
it's impossible to say how much of the observed effect on the metric is
due to lack of accuracy and how much to lack of precision.

<P>Note that model accuracy is related to the likelihood of the model
(<I>i.e.</I> the consistency of the model with the data), and is what is
improved by model building and refinement.&nbsp The difference Fourier
density is obviously a measure of any discrepancy between the model and
the data, so is a direct measure of model accuracy.

<P>Model precision is a property of the crystal and the data (assuming
the refinement is done optimally), and is related to data quality and
completeness, resolution, atom type (or atomic scattering factor),
occupancy and atomic B<SUB>iso</SUB>; hence model precision can only be
improved by crystallizing in a different crystal form and/or collecting
better (<I>e.g.</I> more precise and/or higher resolution) data.&nbsp
The &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> density, divided by its standard uncertainty
(note: this is not the same as RMS(&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>)), is a measure
of model precision which incorporates all the above factors correlated
with precision (<I>e.g.</I> the atomic B<SUB>iso</SUB> is also a
precision metric but it doesn't take account of the variation of
precision with atom type and occupancy).

<P><LI>The sums and min/max functions required to compute all residue or
atom metrics are taken over all map grid points within a specified
distance of each atom centre.&nbsp This distance limit is naturally a
function of the atom type (<I>via</I> the atomic scattering factors
computed from the 5-Gaussian approximation table in $CLIBD/atomsf.lib),
the atomic B<SUB>iso</SUB> values and the resolution limits, as shown in
the following table of the distance limit <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB> for an
O atom.&nbsp Values used by SFALL are also shown for comparison: note
that the latter depend only on B<SUB>iso</SUB> and are independent of
atom type and resolution:

</PRE>
Note that the limiting high-resolution values of <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB>
are attained at ~ d<SUB>min</SUB> = 1.5&Aring;.

<P><LI>The resolution-dependent distance limit is computed by first
performing an analytical truncated Fourier transform of the atomic
scattering factor <I>f</I>(<I>s</I>) to obtain the equation for the
calculated electron density &rho;(<I>r</I>) for data between specified
resolution cut-offs, at distance <I>r</I> from the atom centre:
<PRE>
                               <I>s</I><SUB>max</SUB>
        &rho;(<I>r</I>) = FT(<I>f</I>(<I>s</I>)) = (8/<I>r</I>) &#8747 <I>f</I>(<I>s</I>) exp(-<I>Bs</I><SUP>2</SUP>) sin(4&pi;<I>rs</I>) <I>s</I> d<I>s</I>
                               <I>s</I><SUB>min</SUB>
</PRE>
for specified limits <I>s</I><SUB>min</SUB> and <I>s</I><SUB>max</SUB>
of sin(&theta;)/&lambda;.

<P>Then the ratio of the radius integral of &rho;(<I>r</I>) integrated
out to the outer limit <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB> relative to the radius
integral integrated to infinite distance is:
<PRE>
                               <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB>          &#8734
        Radius integral ratio = &#8747 &rho;(<I>r</I>) d<I>r</I> / &#8747 &rho;(<I>r</I>) d<I>r</I>
                                0           0
</PRE>
and this equation solved to obtain <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB> for a radius
integral ratio = 0.95 (i.e. 95% of the integral lies within distance
<I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB> of the atom centre).&nbsp The integrals with
respect to <I>r</I> can be obtained analytically; the integrals with
respect to <I>s</I> in general have no analytical solution and must be
computed numerically (using <I>e.g.</I> the <A
HREF=http://www.netlib.org/quadpack/doc TARGET=_blank>QUADPACK</A>
library).&nbsp Note that ideally the volume integral of &rho;(<I>r</I>):
<PRE>
                         <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB>           <I>r</I><SUB>max</SUB>
        Volume integral = &#8747 &rho;(<I>r</I>) d<I>V</I> = 4&pi; &#8747 &rho;(<I>r</I>) <I>r</I><SUP>2</SUP> d<I>r</I>
                          0              0
</PRE>
should be used, but unfortunately this integral does not converge.

<P><LI>For the RSZO metric EDSTATS uses the &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> map with
Fourier coefficients 2mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB> for acentric
reflections or mF<SUB>o</SUB> for centrics (Main, 1979; Read, 1986); for
the RSZD metric it uses the &Delta;&rho; (difference Fourier) map with
Fourier coefficients 2(mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB>) for acentrics, or
mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB> for centrics.&nbsp For the RSR and RSCC
metrics it uses the &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> and
&rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> maps.&nbsp
<P>However, for the latter, because we cannot rely on the correct Fourier
coefficient for &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> being present in the file of map
coefficients, it is necessary to obtain it as the difference between the
&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> and &Delta;&rho; coefficients.&nbsp Since we have:
<PRE>
        &Delta;&rho; = &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> - &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB>
</PRE>
or:
<PRE>
        &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> = &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB> - &Delta;&rho;
</PRE>
therefore for acentrics:
<PRE>
        &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> = <FONT FACE=UnifrakturCook>F</FONT>(2mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB>) - <FONT FACE=UnifrakturCook>F</FONT>(2(mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB>))
         <SUB>    </SUB> = <FONT FACE=UnifrakturCook>F</FONT>(DF<SUB>c</SUB>)
</PRE>
whereas for centrics:
<PRE>
        &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> = <FONT FACE=UnifrakturCook>F</FONT>(mF<SUB>o</SUB>) - <FONT FACE=UnifrakturCook>F</FONT>(mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB>)
         <SUB>    </SUB> = <FONT FACE=UnifrakturCook>F</FONT>(DF<SUB>c</SUB>)
</PRE>
Hence the correct Fourier coefficient for &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> is
DF<SUB>c</SUB> for all reflections.&nbsp Note that it is frequently
stated that the coefficient for acentrics is
mF<SUB>o</SUB>-DF<SUB>c</SUB> but if this were used it would give
completely the wrong result for the &rho;<SUB>calc</SUB> coefficient (it
would give mF<SUB>o</SUB> !).

<P><LI>EDSTATS also has options to output data for the histogram, 'P-P
difference' and 'Q-Q difference' plots of the difference Fourier and
observed Fourier maps.&nbsp Note that the 'P-P difference' and 'Q-Q
difference' plots are functionally identical to the standard '<A
HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-P_plot TARGET=_blank>P-P plot </A>'
(probability-probability) and '<A
HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Q_plot TARGET=_blank>Q-Q plot </A>'
(quantile-quantile: 'quantile' is just another name for 'normalised
deviate' or 'Z-score').&nbsp The distinction is purely one of
presentation: whereas the standard 'P-P' or 'Q-Q' plot plots <I>x vs.
y</I>, where <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are respectively the normal expected
and observed probabilitlies or quantiles, the 'P-P difference' or 'Q-Q
difference' plot plots <I>x vs. y-x</I>.

<A NAME=Input>
<H2>INPUT</H2>

The input is in 'namelist' format, i.e. it consists of 'keyword = value'
pairs separated by a comma or newline.&nbsp The keyword is always
case-insensitive and only the first 4 characters are significant.&nbsp
The value may be a character string, a logical (true or t or false or f)
or an integer or real scalar or array.&nbsp The RESLO & RESHI values,
obtainable from an MTZDUMP summary table for the map coefficient columns
(NOT the overall values for the file as given in the MTZ header), are
required; all other input values are optional.

<P>Available options:<UL>

<P><LI>MAIN = <I>string</I>
<BR>Optional specification of type of averaging used to compute
main-chain (including C&beta; atom) R factors and correlation
coefficients (both types), where <I>string</I> is either RESI (default)
or ATOM (both case-insensitive):
<P>RESI averages all map values for the main-chain atoms in each
residue.
<P>ATOM averages the map values for each atom, but reports the extreme
values of these as the residue metrics.
<P>This option has no effect on the real-space Z-scores, which are as
defined in the DESCRIPTION section above.

<P><LI>SIDE = <I>string</I>
<BR>Same as MAIN, but for side-chains.

<P><LI>MOLE = <I>string</I>
<BR>Optional concatenated list of chain IDs defining the molecule for
which metrics are to be calculated (default is to use all atoms).&nbsp
Chain IDs are case-sensitive.

<P><LI>RESC = <I>string</I>
<BR>Optional specification of type of rescaling of &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;)
by Q-Q plot required: <I>string</I> may be ALL, BULK, CHAIN (default) or
NONE (all are case-insensitive).
<P>Scaling type ALL rescales using a single scale factor and offset
based on all map points in the asymmetric unit.
<P>BULK rescales using a single scale factor and offset based only on
points in the bulk solvent.
<P>CHAIN independently rescales each chain and the bulk solvent with a
separate scale factor and offset for each group (ordered waters are
treated as belonging to a single separate chain '0' regardless of their
chain IDs in the PDB file).&nbsp This is now the recommended procedure.
<P>NONE does no Q-Q plot rescaling; the value of &sigma;(&Delta;&rho;)
read from the map header is used, with zero for the offset.

<P><LI>RESLO = <I>real</I>
<BR><B>Required</B> low resolution cut-off used in map calculation.

<P><LI>RESHI = <I>real</I>
<BR><B>Required</B> high resolution cut-off used in map calculation.

<P><LI>THR1 = <I>real</I>
<BR>Optional &sigma; cut-off threshold for Fo map: default is no
cut-off.

<P><LI>THR2= <I>real</I>
<BR>Optional &sigma; cut-off threshold for &Delta;F map: default is no
cut-off.

<BR>Debug flag used for testing and obsolete options: sum of debug
option values as follows:

LS-bit  Value  Output
  0       1    General debugging.
  1       2    P-P & Q-Q difference plots for chains.

  6      64    Normality tests.
</PRE>

<P><LI>USEFO = <I>logical</I>
<BR>A value TRUE indicates that the density histogram and Q-Q difference
plots should use the Fo density instead of the &Delta;F density.&nbsp
This is only intended for demonstration purposes: the Fo density is not
useful in the calculation of the RSZD metrics so with this option set,
the program will stop after doing the Q-Q plot calculations.

<P>Both maps should be calculated with a grid spacing between 1/4 and

<P><B>NOTE</B>: it is essential that the MTZ file from the refinement

<H2>OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<UL>
<LI>HISOUT - Optional output file for the histogram of map values,
containing 2 data columns: the observed Z-score and the observed
frequency.&nbsp This is used for visualising the deviations of the
observed distribution of either &Delta;&rho;/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) (if
USEFO = f), or of &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) (USEFO = t),
from the theoretical normal distribution.&nbsp A normal distribution
would give the Gaussian curve <I>y</I> = exp(-.5 <I>x</I><SUP>2</SUP>) /
&radic;(2&pi;), so deviations from this indicate deviations from
normality.&nbsp However a histogram does not show up outliers nearly as
clearly as the P-P and Q-Q plots (see below), so is really only suitable
for demonstration purposes.&nbsp The output is readily visualised using
a plotting program such as gnuplot, <I>e.g.</I>:

<P><LI>PPDOUT - Optional output file for the 'P-P difference' plot,
containing 2 data columns: the cumulative probability for the normal
distribution, and the difference (inverse normal cumulative probability
of the observed quantile - normal probability).&nbsp The output is
readily visualised using gnuplot (see example for Q-Q difference plot
below).&nbsp The P-P plot is not as informative as the Q-Q plot, and
generally is only used for test purposes.

<P><LI>QQDOUT - Optional output file for the 'Q-Q difference' plot,
containing 2 data columns: the expected quantile (or Z-score) for the
normal distribution, and the difference (observed quantile - normal
expected quantile).&nbsp This is used for visualising the deviations of
the observed distribution of either &Delta;&rho;/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;)
(if USEFO = f), or of &rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) (USEFO =
t) from the normal distribution.&nbsp A normal distribution would give
the straight line <I>y</I> = 0, so deviations from this line indicate
outliers, <I>i.e.</I> deviations from normality (note that the Q-Q plot
does <I>not</I> show deviations from zero density, but rather deviations
from the normal, or other assumed, distribution).&nbsp The numerically
highest outliers will be in the 'tails', <I>i.e.</I> the negative
outliers are the troughs in &Delta;&rho;/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) or
&rho;<SUB>obs</SUB>/&sigma;(&Delta;&rho;) and the positive outliers are
the peaks.&nbsp The output is readily visualised (with the 'normal'
<I>y</I> = 0 line) using gnuplot, <I>e.g.</I>:

<A NAME=Analysing>
<H2>ANALYSING THE STANDARD OUTPUT: OVERALL METRICS</H2>

The default run options will produce 2 files: the standard output from
edstats (edstats.log in the example above) which contains some overall
metrics, and the output file (<I>e.g.</I>edstats.out) containing the
table of per-residue metrics (see following section).

<P>The supplied Perl script percent-rank.pl extracts a small subset of
the overall metrics from the standard output, compares the results with
a pre-calculated set in the supplied data file pdb-edstats.out, and for
each metric prints out the per-cent rank (<I>i.e.</I> the percentage of
structures in the pre-calculated set which have a worse score, so 0% is
'worst' and 100% is 'best').&nbsp This is intended to a give a quick
overview of the state of the difference Fourier and is not a meant as a
substitute for interpreting the per-residue metrics (see next
section).&nbsp Generally you would probably want your structure to score
above average on all measures, so at least above the median 50%
rank.&nbsp But obviously not every structure can be above average!

<P>The data file pdb-edstats.out, or a link to it, must be present in
the current directory; alternatively set the environment variable
PDB_EDSTATS to point to it.&nbsp The data were obtained by running
edstats on ~ 600 supposedly 'good' structures (anonymous!) from <A
HREF=http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb_redo>PDB_REDO</A> with Rfree &lt 0.175
and > 100 residues (protein only).&nbsp This is not ideal, since it
would clearly be much better to bin the known structures by high
resolution cut-off and compare your structure only with known structures
at roughly the same resolution; however this will require a much larger
database than I have the resources to set up in the short term.&nbsp
Hopefully this feature will be developed and improved in a future
release.

<P>The columns in the data file pdb-edstats.out contain:

<OL><LI>High resolution cut-off.

<P><LI>Resolution-weighted average B<SUB>iso</SUB> (<I>e.g.</I> the
effective average of B<SUB>iso</SUB>s 10 and 100 is not 55 but something
much closer to 10, depending on the resolution cut-offs, since the atom
with B<SUB>iso</SUB> = 100 only contributes significantly to the
scattering at low resolution).

<P><LI>Q-Q plot ZD- metric: this gives an overall indication of how much
the distribution of all negative difference density in the asymmetric
unit deviates from the expected normal distribution for purely random
errors.&nbsp Significant negative density outliers giving a high
numerical Q-Q plot ZD- metric probably indicates wrongly placed atoms,
over-restrained B factors, problems with the bulk solvent parameters
(<I>e.g.</I> due to low completeness at low resolution), or generally
low data completeness.

<P><LI>Q-Q plot ZD+ metric: ditto for all positive difference
density.&nbsp Low per-cent ranks (large values) for this metric are not
as indicative of problems as are low ranks for the Q-Q plot ZD- metric
above, because it can be difficult to interpret residual density
outliers due to disorder, buffer ions, cryo-protectants and other
additives, so uninterpreted (and uninterpretable) density is quite
common in deposited structures.&nbsp Consequently a high value for the
Q-Q plot ZD+ metric does not necessarily indicate a serious problem; it
would be better to check the per-residue RSZD+ scores.

<P><LI>Percentage of residue RSZD- metrics numerically above the
3&sigma; threshold (see also next section).

<P><LI>Percentage of residue RSZD+ metrics above the 3&sigma; threshold.
</OL>

<P>The percent-rank.pl script prints out the per-cent ranks for metrics
3-6 above.

<P>Examples of usage:
<PRE>
percent-rank.pl edstats.log
or
percent-rank.pl *.log
</PRE>

Note that the overall statistics for the RSZO metrics which appear in
the standard output are not listed by the percent-rank.pl script; this
is deliberate: the RSZO metric is a measure of precision and is really
only meaningful when analysed at the residue level.&nbsp For example it
may be that only say 50% of the residues score above the threshold of
the precision metric, but if these 50% tell you all that you wanted to
know about the biological function, then clearly the experiment can be
counted as a success (assuming of course that all residues have
acceptable scores for the accuracy metrics).&nbsp So it all depends on
which residues have high values of the precision metric.&nbsp On the
other hand, if only 50% of residues scored above the threshold for the
accuracy metric then this would be regarded as a poor result, no matter
which residues they were.

<A NAME=Interpreting>
<H2>INTERPRETING THE PER-RESIDUE METRICS</H2>

For the per-residue metrics listed in the output file (<I>e.g.</I>
edstats.out) I have suggested rejection limits of &lt -3&sigma; and &gt
3&sigma; for the residue RSZD-/+ metrics respectively, and &lt 1&sigma;
for the residue RSZO metrics, though these may need to be adjusted in
the light of experience.

<P>The RSZD scores are accuracy metrics, <I>i.e.</I> at least in theory
they can be improved by adjusting the model (by eliminating the obvious
difference density), so start by checking the worst offenders
first.&nbsp Use the Fourier and difference maps in your favourite
graphics model-building program to guide any adjustments of the model
that may be required, in the usual way.&nbsp Note that positive density
deviations are usually more frequent than negative ones, because they
represent uninterpretable, as opposed to incorrectly interpreted
density, and are therefore less symptomatic of underlying problems.

<P>The RSZO scores are precision metrics and will be strongly correlated
with the B<SUB>iso</SUB>s (since that is also a precision metric),
<I>i.e.</I> assuming you've fixed any issues with accuracy of that
residue there's nothing you can do about the precision, short of
re-collecting the data.

<P>The RSR and RSCC (both 'sample' and 'population') metrics are
tabulated for comparison but are correlated with both accuracy and
precision, so they can be useful in some circumstances, but they don't
always help with telling you whether adjustment of the model is
required, or whether the problem is actually an intrinsic property of
the structure, or lies with the data.&nbsp Note that the RSR and RSCC
metrics vary with the program used, since they depend strongly on the
radius cut-off, scaling algorithm and other variables which can vary a
lot between programs.
