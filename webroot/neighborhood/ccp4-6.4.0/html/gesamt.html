<H1> GESAMT (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>

<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>gesamt </b>
- General Efficient Structural Alignment of Macromolecular Targets

<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<p>
1. Printout of usage instructions:
<p>
<b>gesamt</b> --help
<p>
2. Alignment and superposition of two structures:
<p>
<b>gesamt</b> <i>foo_1st.pdb</i> [{-s|-d} SEL1] <i>foo_2nd.pdb</i> [{-s|-d} SEL2]
[-high|-normal] [<i>foo_out.pdb</i>]
<p>
3. Screening a pdb archive:
<p>
<b>gesamt</b> <i>foo.pdb</i> [{-s|-d} SEL] -pdb <i>pdb-dir</i> 
[-high|-normal] [<i>hits.txt</i>]<br>
<p>
where <i>SEL1/2</i> are optional selection strings and <i>foo_out.pdb</i> is an
optional output file.
<p>&nbsp;<br>
Keys "-s" and "-d" are used for the selection of a substructure. By default, all
structure given in the corresponding file, is used. If there are more than one
chain in the file, all chains are considered as a single structure. Selection
format depends on the key used. Key "-s" correspondds to MMDB selection format,
identical to what is used by
<a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/superpose.html">Superpose</a>. The
format is described in <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/pdbcur.html#atom_selection">pdbcur</a>
documentation. CCP4i interface works only with this type of selections.
<p>
Selection key "-d" provides a more flexible selection scheme used by SCOP:
<p>
<table>
<tr><td NOWRAP VALIGN="top">"*", "(all)"</td>
    <td VALIGN="top">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
    <td>take all file</td>
</tr>
<tr><td NOWRAP VALIGN="top">"-"</td>
    <td VALIGN="top">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
    <td>take chain without chain ID</td>
</tr>
<tr><td NOWRAP VALIGN="top">"a:Ni-Mj,b:Kp-Lq,..."</td>
    <td VALIGN="top">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
    <td>take chain <i>a</i> residue number <i>N</i>
        insertion code <i>i</i> to residue number <i>M</i>
        insertion code <i>j</i> plus chain <i>b</i>
        residue number <i>K</i> insertion code <i>p</i> to
        residue number <i>L</i> insertion code <i>q</i> and
        so on
    </td>
</tr>
<tr><td NOWRAP VALIGN="top">"a:,b:..."</td>
    <td VALIGN="top">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
    <td>take whole chains <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and so on</td>
</tr>
<tr><td NOWRAP VALIGN="top">"a:,b:Kp-Lq,..."</td>
    <td VALIGN="top">&nbsp;-&nbsp;</td>
    <td>any combination of the above.</td>
</tr>
</table>

In difference of <a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/dist/html/superpose.html">
Superpose</a>, Gesamt allows for arbitrary selection of residues, and
disregards the secondary structure pattern of structures. Gesampt may be
applied to non-contiguous sets of residues, partially complete and
short chains.

<H2><a name="description"> DESCRIPTION</a></H2>

<tt>gesamt</tt> aligns two structures by an efficient clustering of short
fragments, made from adjacent protein backbone C-alpha atoms, followed
by an iterative three-dimensional refinement based on a dynamic
programming procedure.

<H2> INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>

<H3>foo_1st.pdb</H3>
First input coordinate file. Although typically a PDB file, it can also be
in mmCIF or MMDB binary formats. The input format is detected automatically.
This is considered the Query structure to which the transformation matrix
will be applied.

<H3>foo_2nd.pdb</H3>
Second input coordinate file. Although typically a PDB file, it can also be
in mmCIF or MMDB binary formats. The input format is detected automatically.
This is considered the Target structure.

<h3>foo_out.pdb</h3>
If specified, the result of applying the transformation matrix
to <tt>foo_1st.pdb</tt> is written to <tt>foo_out.pdb</tt>.

<h3>pdb-dir</h3>
A directory with pdb files to align <H3>foo.pdb</H3> with. Gesamt will screen
any selection of pdb files in given directory. Only files with extensions
".pdb", ".ent", ".pdb.gz' and ".ent.gz" are looked at.

<h3>hits.txt</h3>
Optional output file with the list of calculated alignments ordered by the
decreasing Q-score.

<h2>Command line options</h2>

The optional selection strings <tt>[{-s|-d} SEL1/2]</tt> are in the
format described above.
<p>
Keys "-high" and "-normal" specify "High" and "Normal" mode, respectively. In
"Normal" mode (default), Gesamt balances the quality of alignment and
computation speed. This is a recommended mode for most applications. In "High"
mode, Gesamt attempts to reach maximal quality with no reference to speed
considerations. In "High" mode, Gesamt is about 10 times slower and achieves
quality improvement in few percents of all instances on comparison with
"Normal" mode.

<H2> PROGRAM OUTPUT</H2>

The program reports the Transformation Matrix calculated for
superimposing <tt>foo_1st.pdb</tt> onto <tt>foo_2nd.pdb</tt>
and the RMSD from the superposition, as well as polar and Euler
rotation angles and orthogonal translation vector.
<p>
The program then gives a residue-by-residue listing of the
alignment. Strands and helices in the two structures are identified and
given in the output. The output also lists distances between all matched
residues at best structure superposition.
