context otherwise requires, have the following meanings:
</p><p>Commencement Date means the initial date of download of the Software from its

</p><p>Software means the computer program and version listed at the head of this
Agreement.
</p><p>2. GRANT OF LICENCE
</p><p>2.1 CUTS hereby grants to the Licensee and the Licensee hereby accepts a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free licence, commencing on the
Commencement Date and for a term of five years therefrom, to download, install
and use the Software subject to the following terms and conditions:
</p><p>(a) the Licensee may use the Software solely for its internal use and the
Licensee shall not sell, give, disclose, lend, transfer, sublicense or
otherwise distribute the Software to any third party, or allow the Software to
be accessed over the internet or in any other manner that would allow access

</p><p>(b) the Licensee may create Derivatives solely for its own internal use but
shall not distribute the Software or any Derivatives in whole or in part to
any third party; 
</p><p>(c) the Software may be installed and used only on computers owned or leased
by the Licensee;
</p><p>(d) the Licensee may copy the Software solely to the extent necessary to

Software the following copyright notice: ï¿½ 2000-2005. Cambridge University
Technical Services Limited.  All rights reserved.
</p><p>3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
</p><p>3.1 The Licensee acknowledges that all Intellectual Property Rights in the
Software and any copies thereof belong and shall belong to CUTS and the
Licensee shall have no rights in or to the Software other than the right to
use it in accordance with the terms of the Licence in this Agreement.
</p><p>3.2 Title to and ownership of any portion of the Software incorporated into
Derivatives shall at all times remain with CUTS and the Licensee shall not
have any title or ownership interest therein.
</p><p>3.3 Title to and ownership of any portion of Derivatives created by the
Licensee and not owned by CUTS pursuant to Clauses 3.1 and 3.2 above shall be
held by the Licensee.  Nothing contained in this Licence shall be construed to
limit CUTS rights to modify or to develop other derivatives of the Software
which are similar to or offer the same or similar improvements as any
Derivatives developed by the Licensee.
</p><p>3.4 Error fixes, bug fixes, technical suggestions, comments and suggested
improvements to the Software and its code are welcome by the authors of the
Software and CUTS, and in agreeing to provide these to the authors or to CUTS
the Licensee hereby assigns the Intellectual Property Rights in error fixes,
bug fixes, or technical improvements to CUTS which are communicated in any
manner or medium to the authors of the Software or CUTS with a reservation of
use of those improvements and suggestions by the Licensee subject to the terms
and conditions of the Licence in this Agreement.
</p><p>4. NO MAINTENANCE OR SUPPORT
</p><p>4.1 CUTS is under no obligation whatsoever to:
</p><p>(a) provide maintenance or support for the Software; or
</p><p>(b) notify the Licensee of error fixes, bug fixes, patches, or upgrades to
the features, functionality or performance of the Software ("Enhancements")
(if any), whether developed by CUTS or third parties.  If, in its sole
discretion, CUTS makes an Enhancement available to the Licensee and CUTS does
not separately enter into a written licence agreement with the Licensee
relating to such bug fix, patch or upgrade, then it shall be deemed
incorporated into the Software and subject to this Agreement.
</p><p>5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
</p><p>5.1 CUTS warrants that the Software will conform substantially with its
functional specifications.  Otherwise the Software is supplied "as is" without
warranty of any kind.  CUTS, its licensors and its employees:
</p><p>(a) disclaim any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to
any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title or non-infringement of third party rights;
</p><p>(b) do not assume any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy,
completeness, or usefulness of the Software;
</p><p>(c) do not represent that use of the Software will not infringe privately
owned rights;
</p><p>(d) do not warrant that the Software will function uninterrupted, that it is
error-free or that any errors will be corrected.
</p><p>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
</p><p>6.1 The Software is provided for academic non-commercial purposes only.
Therefore, in no event will CUTS or its licensors or its employees be liable
to the Licensee for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special or
punitive damages of any kind or nature, including but not limited to loss of
profits or loss of data, for any reason whatsoever, whether such liability is
asserted on the basis of contract, tort (including negligence or strict
liability), or otherwise, even if CUTS has been warned of the possibility of
such loss or damages.
</p><p>6.2 The limitations and exclusions in this Agreement shall not apply in
respect of claims for personal injury or death caused by the negligence of
CUTS, its licensors or its employees or in respect of fraud or fraudulent
misrepresentation.  
</p><p>7. INDEMNITY
</p><p>7.1 The Licensee shall indemnify CUTS, the Software authors, the Software
sponsors, and their agents, officers, and employees, against any and all
claims, suits, losses, damages, costs, fees, and expenses arising out of or in
connection with any claim or threatened claim by any third party relating to
or arising from the use of the Software by the Licensee.  The Licensee shall
pay all costs incurred by CUTS in enforcing this provision.
</p><p>8. TERM AND TERMINATION
</p><p>8.1 This Agreement and the Licence granted herein shall come into effect
on the Commencement Date and will continue for the duration of five years
therefrom unless terminated by CUTS in accordance with this Agreement.  If the
Licensee breaches any term of this Agreement, and fails to cure such breach
within thirty (30) days of the date of written notice, this Agreement shall
immediately terminate.  Upon such termination the Licensee shall immediately
cease using the Software, return to CUTS or destroy all copies of the
Software, and provide CUTS with written certification of the Licensee's
compliance with the foregoing.  Termination shall not relieve the Licensee
from its obligations arising prior to such termination.  Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Sections 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
13, 14 and 18 shall survive termination of this Agreement.  
</p><p>9. CONFIDENTIALITY
</p><p>9.1 The Licensee agrees and undertakes that during the term of the Licence in
this Agreement and thereafter it will keep confidential all, and will not use
for its own purposes nor without the prior written consent of CUTS disclose to
any third party any information of a confidential nature (including trade
secrets and information of commercial value) which may become known to the
Licensee and which relates to CUTS unless such information is public knowledge
or already known to the Licensee at the time of disclosure or subsequently
becomes public knowledge other by breach of the Licence in this Agreement or
subsequently comes lawfully into the possession of the Licensee from a third
party.
</p><p>10. NO SUBLICENSING AND NO ASSIGNMENT 
</p><p>10.1 The Licensee shall have no right to sub-license or to assign,
transfer, charge or deal in any other manner the benefit or burden of the
Licence in this Agreement in whole or in part or to allow the Software to
become the subject of any charge, lien or encumbrance without the prior
written consent of CUTS such consent may be withheld without giving any
reasons.
</p><p>11. WAIVER
</p><p>11.1 No forbearance or delay by either party in enforcing its rights will
prejudice or restrict the rights of that party, and no waiver of any such
rights or of any breach of any contractual terms will be deemed to be a waiver
of any other right or of any later breach.
</p><p>12. SEVERABILITY
</p><p>12.1 If any provision of the Licence in this Agreement is judged to be
illegal or unenforceable, the continuation in full force and effect of the
remainder of the provisions will not be prejudiced.
</p><p>13. NO AGENCY OR PARTNERSHIP
</p><p>13.1 Nothing contained or implied in this Agreement constitutes a Party the
partner, agent, or legal representative of another party or of the other Party
for any purpose or creates any partnership, agency or trust, and no Party has
any authority to bind the other Party in any way.
</p><p>14. THE CONTRACTS (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES) ACT 1999
</p><p>14.1 The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 shall not apply to
this Agreement and nothing in this Agreement shall confer or purport to confer
on or operate to give any third Party any benefit or any right to enforce any
term of this Agreement.
</p><p>15. NOTICES
</p><p>15.1 Any notice to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and
delivered by hand, prepaid registered post or facsimile to a Party at the
address set out at the head of this Agreement or to such other address or fax
number as any Party may specify in writing to another.  Notices are deemed to
