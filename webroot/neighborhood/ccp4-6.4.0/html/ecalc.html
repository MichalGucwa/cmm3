<H2> <A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The program ECALC is used to calculate normalised structure
amplitudes for a reflection data set. The normalised structure
amplitude for a reflection is taken as:
<pre>

                   |F| / sqrt(epsilon)
      E  =  --------------------------------
             rms of ( |F| / sqrt(epsilon) )

</pre>
Here, F is a structure factor amplitude. This may be the true structure
factor amplitude, or a difference term representing the contribution of a 
sub-structure of heavy atoms or anomalous scatterers, depending on the
<a href="#labin">LABIN</a> keyword. Epsilon is the symmetry factor which
increases the mean intensities for certain planes or lines in reciprocal 
space, and is determined by the Laue group symmetry. The r.m.s. value in
the denominator is calculated as a function of the resolution, and
normalises the data such that &lt;E^2&gt; = 1.
<p>
Normalised structure amplitudes are used for direct methods programs,
molecular replacement searches, etc.  ECALC also generates the terms
required to calculate
<a href="#origin_removed_patterson">origin-removed Pattersons.</a>
<p> 
The normalisation procedure used is done using the "Karle" approach,
and <B>NOT</B> by applying an overall temperature factor taken from a
Wilson plot, i.e. the amplitudes are modified so that
&lt;E**2&gt; = 1.0 in each resolution shell. This is necessary for
macromolecular structures where the low resolution &lt;I&gt;
distribution is very different from the Wilson ideal.
<p> 
The output MTZ file will contain all entries in the input file plus
F E SIGE F2OR E2OR. These are described in more detail below.

<H3><A NAME="labin"></A> LABIN &lt;program label&gt;=&lt;file label&gt; ...</H3>
Column label assignments for 
<B>H</B>, <B>K</B>, <B>L</B>, and optionally <B>FP</B>, <B>SIGFP</B>, <B>FPH</B>,
<B>SIGFPH</B>, <B>DPH</B>, <B>SIGDPH</B>.
<p>
<b>FP</b>
is one structure amplitude, possibly a native amplitude, 
or maybe F(+) for data with an anomalous signal<br>
<b>SIGFP</b>
is its standard deviation<br>
<b>FPH</b>
is another structure amplitude, either a derivative set or F(-)<br>
<b>SIGFPH</b>
is its standard deviation<br>
<b>DPH</b>
is the derivative anomalous difference<br>
<b>SIGDPH</b>
is its standard deviation<br>
<p>  
The behavior of the program is largely governed by the column assignments.
Data is assumed missing if the associated SIG is less than or equal to 0, 
or the missing number flag is set.
<ol>
 <li>If only <b>FP</b> (and <b>SIGFP</b>) are assigned, the amplitude assigned 
to <b>FP</b> is used to calculate the E value. 
 
 <li>If <b>FPH</b> is also assigned, the structure "amplitude" used to calculate 
the F and E values for output is the magnitude of the difference between
the columns assigned to <b>FP</b> and <b>FPH</b> (<EM>i.e.</EM>,  if <b>FP</b> is 
a native, and <b>FHP</b> a derivative amplitude this is the isomorphous difference, 
or if <b>FP</b> is set as <b>F(+)</b> and <b>FPH</b> as <b>F(-) it is an anomalous 
difference </b>). If using this to define an "anomalous difference" it is sensible 
to use the EXCLUDE keyword to exclude centric terms.
The difference may be reduced to take into account the overestimation due to the 
noise in each measurement. See <A HREF="#moddiff">MODDIFF</A>.

 <li> If <b>DPH</b> is assigned, then none of <b>FP</b> <b>SIGFP</b> <b>FPH</b> or 
<b>SIGFPH</b> should be assigned. The structure "amplitude" used to calculate the 
F and E values for output is the magnitude of the anomalous difference <b>DPH</b>. 
Centric reflections will not be used. Again, the difference may be reduced to take 
into account the overestimation due to the noise in the measurement. See 
<A HREF="#moddiff">MODDIFF</A>. 
</ol>

<H3><A NAME="exclude"></A> EXCLUDE [CENTRIC] [SIGP &lt;nsigp&gt;] [SIGPH &lt;nsigph&gt;]
[FPMAX &lt;fpmax&gt;] [FPHMAX &lt;fphmax&gt;] [DIFF &lt;diffmax&gt;]</H3>
Set criteria for excluding data from the generation of E values.
Large errors can distort the normalisation seriously.
<P>
Excluded data will still be written to the output file but there will be no
associated value for E; it will be flagged as a "Missing number".
The default is to include all data.
<p>
<dl><dt>The following subkeys select the tests to be applied:<dd>
<dl>
<dt> CENTRIC <dd>
exclude all centric reflections - required for the use of anomalous differences
<dt> SIGP &lt;nsigp&gt;<dd>
exclude reflections if FP &lt; &lt;nsigp&gt;* SIGP
<dt> SIGPH &lt;nsigph&gt;<dd>
exclude reflections if FPH &lt; &lt;nsigph&gt;* SIGPH
<dt> FPMAx &lt;fpmax&gt;<dd>
exclude reflections if FP  &gt; &lt;fpmax&gt;
<dt> FPHMax &lt;fphmax&gt;<dd>
exclude reflections if FPH &gt; &lt;fphmax&gt;
<dt> DIFF &lt;diffmax&gt; <dd>
exclude reflections if the isomorphous or anomalous difference is greater than  &lt;diffmax&gt;
 See LABIN and MODDIFF for further discussion on generating these differences. </dl>
</dl>

<H3><A NAME="moddiff"></A> MODDIFF [ YES | NO ] </H3>
Default NO.
<p>
In general the differences used to estimate the isomorphous or anomalous contributions
will be overestimated as a result of noise in the measurements. 
It is possible to apply a correction and approximate the difference by
sqrt( |FPH-FP|**2 - Sqrt*(SIGFP**2 + SIGFPH**2) ) or sqrt( |DPH|**2 - Sqrt*(SIGDPH**2) ).
If the term to be square-rooted is negative the difference is set to 0.0.
It is obviously important that the standard deviations are reasonably reliable.

<H3><A NAME="labout"></A> LABOUT &lt;program label&gt;=&lt;file label&gt; ...</H3>
This card can be used when outputting reflections to an MTZ file to assign
customised labels to the additional output columns.

<p>The following additional columns will be output and labels can be assigned:</p>

<pre>     FECALC    E  SIGE      F2OR      E2OR
</pre>

<p>where</p>

<dl>
<dt>FECALC</dt>
<dd>is the "amplitude" used for the normalisation, either FP or |FPH-FP| or |DPH| </dd>

<dt>E and SIGE </dt>

<dd>the normalised "amplitude" and standard deviation modified so 
that &lt;E**2&gt; = 1.0 in all resolution shells. Note that column E
now has MTZ type 'E' (it was previously 'F').</dd>

<dt> F2OR and E2OR</dt>

<dd> The terms required for calculating an origin removed Patterson.
 F2OR = F**2 -&lt;E**2&gt;  and E2OR = E**2 - &lt;E**2&gt; =  E**2 - 1.0.

They can be used as input to the fft programs using LABI I=F2OR, etc ( See fft documentation) </dd>
</dl>

<H3><A NAME="resolution"></A> RESOLUTION &lt;resmax&gt;</H3>
Default: take the maximum resolution from the MTZ header.
The value &lt;resmax&gt; is the resolution cutoff in Angstroms.  
Usually 0 to include all reflections.

<H3><A NAME="shell"></A> SHELL &lt;number&gt;</H3>
Specifies the approximate number (default 200) of reflections wanted 
to average for each shell.
If this is too small you are likely to get wildly fluctuating <F**2> or
even shells with no reflections at all. The program will issue a warning "Empty shell".  
If it is too big there may not be enough shells to give sensible averages.  
Note this number refers to independent reflections; however the output shows the number in
a hemisphere of reciprocal space.

<H3><A NAME="spacegroup"></A> SPACEGROUP &lt;group&gt;</H3>
The space group is read from file with logical name SYMOP.
Default: Take the SPACEGROUP from the MTZ header.
<i>Group</i>
is the space group name or number in International Tables.  Only the 
rotation part of the symmetry operations is used, so for example 
177 (P622), 178 (P6122) and 179 (P6522) are all equivalent.
This keyword is required only if the symmetry information in the
reflection file header is missing or wrong.
<H3><A NAME="title"></A> TITLE &lt;title&gt; </H3>
Title for the output file (up to 80 characters).  The text PRODUCED
BY ECALC will be appended to this title automatically.

<H3><A NAME="scale"></A> SCALE &lt;scale&gt;</H3>
The output columns F  will be scaled by the value &lt;scale&gt;. 
The default scale is 1.0.

<H3><A NAME="multan"></A> MULTAN </H3>
No further data are required on this line.  Outputs E values in a
formatted ASCII file <EM>e.g.</EM> for Direct Method packages such as
MULTAN. Normally however, most 
Direct Method programs will calculate Es internally. Default is to output E 
values in standard MTZ format <EM>e.g.</EM>, for <a href="almn.html">ALMN</a>.

<H3><A NAME="snb"></A> SNB</H3>
No further data are required on this line.  Outputs E values in a
formatted ASCII file suitable for SnB (Shake-and-Bake).

<H3><A NAME="reflections"></A> REFLECTIONS &lt;nwant&gt;</H3>
This only applies when outputting reflections to an ASCII file and not an MTZ file
<EM>i.e.</EM> in conjunction with the MULTAN/SNB cards. The 
largest &lt;nwant&gt; Es are written 
to HKLOUT, the default is to write all reflections. This cutoff may be 
necessary because some programs will only accept a limited number of
reflections. Also, when generating Es from isomorphous or anomalous 
differences, i.e. |FPH-FP| or |F(+)-F(-)|, small E values will not 
necessarily reflect the true E value calculated from the heavy atom 
sub-structure. For instance, for anomalous differences all the centric 
reflections have an E of zero.

<H2><A NAME="files"></A> INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
The input files are 
<P> 
The control data file.
<dl>
<dt> HKLIN<dd>
The input reflection data file in standard MTZ format.
<dt> HKLOUT<dd>
If no MULTAN/SNB keyword is specified, the output file is a reflection data
file in MTZ format containing the items H K L (all input) + F E  SIGE  where F=FP
is copied from the input file if only FP is assigned,
or F=sqrt(max((FPH-FP)^2 -
SIGFP^2-SIGFPH^2,0)) if FPH is assigned as well.
E is the normalised structure amplitude, SIGE is its standard deviation.  
</dl>
<P> 
For the MULTAN option the output is
H K L 1000*E in FORMAT(3I4,I6) terminated by E=-1.
<dl>
<dt> SYMOP<dd>
The library symmetry data file, normally defaulted.
</dl>
<H2> PRINTER OUTPUT</H2>
The line printer output may be divided into the following sections:
<ol>
<li>
Echo of the input control data.
<li>
A table showing the distribution of the reflections in shells (chosen to give
roughly equal numbers per shell) with mean d*^3, F^2, E^2-1 and (E^2-1)^2.
<li>
Scatter plot of F versus d*^2 with a smoothed plot of r.m.s. F versus d*^2
superimposed.
<li>
Mean values of E^2 and (E^2-1)^2 by parity groups.
<li>
Mean values of E^n where n = 1 to 6.
<br>
Mean values of |E^2-1|^n where n = 1 to 3.
<br>
For each mean the theoretical value for the acentric, centric and
hypercentric distributions is also tabulated.
<li>
Cumulative distribution of E's for centric and acentric with theoretical
values.  This table can also be graphed with xloggraph.

<H2><A NAME="program_structure"></A> PROGRAM STRUCTURE</H2>
The program structure is straightforward and involves three passes
through the input reflection data file. The structure is outlined
below:
<ul>
<li>
Open files
<li>
Pass 1 through reflection data: Find maximum F and S values and count
the number of reflections.  Print these values.
<li>
Pass 2 through reflection data: Collect F^2 values in bins of d*^3
(sums and numbers of reflections).  Print a table of these results.
Apply adjacent channel smoothing for points giving the average F^2
and d*^3 values for these bins.
<li>
Open the output mtz file.
<li>
Pass 3 through reflection data: Calculate E values (using the function
AVF, write the output reflection data and collect data for the
statistics.
<li>
Print scatter plot, average values of E^1 to E^6 and cumulative
distribution of E's.
</ul>
