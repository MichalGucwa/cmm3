<H1> EXTENDS (CCP4: Unsupported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>extends </b>
- Extend Fourier maps and compute standard uncertainty of electron
density.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>extends mapin</b>
<i>foo_in.map</i>
<b>mapout</b>
<i>foo_out.map</i>
[
<b>xyzin</b>
<i>foo_in.brk</i>
]
<br>
 [Key-worded input] 
<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>
The program 
<b>EXTENDS </b>
generates any part of a map from a map calculated
by the <b>FFT</b> program which typically contains only one asymmetric unit.  
<P>
This is a modified version of the <b>EXTEND</b> program that attempts to
compute the standard uncertainty of the electron density.&nbsp; To do this
the input map must be a true difference map (i.e. of the type Fo-Fc, not
nFo-(n-1)Fc) and must consist of <b>exactly one</b> asymmetric unit (an
integral number of a.u.'s such as <b>exactly</b> half or an <b>exact</b> complete unit
cell is also valid input).&nbsp; Note that the program does <b>NOT</b>
check that the input map covers an exact integral number of a.u.'s: it
is the user's responsibility to ensure this.&nbsp; However this will
normally be the case if the <b>FFT</b> program has been used to prepare
the input map.
<P>
The rationale for this is statistical rigour: the asymmetric unit of
the map represents the true population of electron density values in
the statistical sense and therefore the values of the mean and RMS
deviation for the asymmetric unit can be considered to be those of
the true population mean and population standard deviation
respectively.&nbsp; Any other subset or superset of the map that is not
an integral number of asymmetric units is a sample in the statistical
sense, with corresponding sample mean and sample standard deviation.
<P>
It may even be a biased sample either because the density covers only
a specific region of the structure and is therefore
non-representative of the map as a whole, or because when a map is extended,
density values related by the map symmetry are very likely to be
generated more than once.&nbsp; Sample statistics, whether biased or not,
are always only approximations to population statistics.
<P>
Note that the standard deviation of the density, unlike the RMS
deviation of the density from its mean value, is a property of the
density that does <b>NOT</b> change simply because a different map
extent is chosen.&nbsp; Most other programs that output electron density
maps that do not cover an exact integral number of a.u.'s always
automatically recompute both the mean and RMSD - if this is done it is
then not valid to treat the RMSD in subsequent calculations as though it
were the SU of the density.

<H2> KEY WORDED INPUT</H2>
The data control lines are identified by keywords.
Only the first 4 letters of each keyword are necessary.
Some data cards are optional.
The available keywords are: XYZLIM, SYMMETRY, BORDER, FILL, KEEP and END.&nbsp; They
are all optional, but some must be specified if XYZIN isn't assigned.
<H2> DESCRIPTION OF KEYWORDS</H2>
<H3> XYZLIM &lt;xmin&gt; &lt;xmax&gt; &lt;ymin&gt; &lt;ymax&gt; &lt;zmin&gt; &lt;zmax&gt;</H3>
Output map limits in grid points or fractions of cell edge.
If this card is not given XYZIN must be assigned. The program then reads the
coordinates to determine the map limits.
<H3> SYMMETRY &lt;Name&gt; | &lt;Number&gt;</H3>
Followed by space group Name (e.g. P212121) or Number (e.g. 19).
Symmetry is usually read from the header of the input map so this
keyword is not normally needed. Use it only to change symmetry, or if
no symmetry is present in the map. This is needed after certain
non-CCP4 programs e.g. from Uppsala.
<H3> MAPSYM  &lt;Name&gt; | &lt;Number&gt;</H3>
Inserts the specified space group symmetry operators into the output
map, but does not use them for extending the map. This may be needed
after `skewing' a map, since that map will have only X,Y,Z symmetry,
but be careful.
<H3> BORDER &lt;width&gt;</H3>
&lt;width&gt; of border in Angstroms to add to coordinate limits.
<P> 
Default = 10 Angstroms. This card is only needed if XYZLIM is
not given; otherwise limits are determined from the XYZIN coordinate file.

<H3>FILL &lt;fill&gt;</H3>
<P>
Set map values outside borders of input map to &lt;fill&gt;.

<H3>KEEP</H3>
<P>
Keep the input RMSD of the density.&nbsp; This option should be used only
for 2mFo-DFc and other types of non-difference Fouriers, <i>i.e.</i>
with coefficients of the form nFo-(n-1)Fc.&nbsp; In some cases the
program can detect that a non-difference Fourier has been input and will
not recompute the standard uncertainty; however it would not be wise to
rely on this!
<P>
The RMSD of a 2mFo-DFc or equivalent map is completely devoid of any
statistical meaning anyway: it will greatly depend on the solvent
content, so comparing Fourier maps contoured at 1 sigma is nonsense
(pointed out by Dale Tronrud!).
<P>
For mFo-DFc and other types of true difference Fouriers this option must
be <b>omitted</b> so that the program is allowed to recompute the standard
uncertainty.&nbsp; In this case the input map must consist of <b>exactly one</b>
asymmetric unit (an integral number of a.u.'s such as <b>exactly</b> half or
a complete unit cell is also valid input).&nbsp; This will normally be the
case if the <b>FFT</b> program has been used to prepare the input map.
<P>
This option should also be used in the case that the input map does not
cover an exact integral number of a.u.'s, but the SU of the density has
been previously correctly computed, so that the correct SU is kept and
copied to the output map.
<H3> END</H3>
Ends input.
<H2> INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
<dl>
<dt> MAPIN<dd>
input map (from FFT)
<dt> MAPOUT<dd>
extended output map
<dt> XYZIN<dd>
input coordinates, optional unless limits not given.
</dl>
<H2> PROGRAM FUNCTION</H2>
The program EXTENDS is used to extend the range of Fourier map or to
calculate a different part of the unit cell from that input.&nbsp; Its
main use is in preparing data for programs that process electron density
and require an accurate value of the standard uncertainty.
