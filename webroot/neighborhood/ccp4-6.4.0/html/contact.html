<H1> CONTACT (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>contact </b>
- computes various types of contacts in protein structures
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>contact XYZIN</b>
<i>foo.pdb</i>
<br>
 [<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>]

<H2><A NAME="description"></A> DESCRIPTION</H2>
Program for computing various types of contacts in protein structures. Can also
analyse water hydrogen bonding. The program uses a bricking algorithm in
which atoms are segregated into 6x6x6 A boxes and contact searching is
limited to neighbouring boxes; this is very fast. CONTACT reads a standard
Brookhaven data bank file which must contain SCALE cards if MODE = IMOL or
AUTO. 
<P> 
Maximum residue number is 9000. Maximum number of atoms is 96000.
Restrictions on the number of symmetry operations allowed in IMOL and AUTO
modes, present in older versions, have been eased.
<pre>

  ( PARAMETER (MXATOM=96000,MXRES=9000,MXSYMM=230) )
  MXSYMM is: maximum number of symm. operations + 27

</pre>

<H2> <A NAME="keywords"></A>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>
The program uses the routine PARSER to read in the control data. It only
checks the first 4 characters of each keyword which can be upper or lower
case. The order of the cards is not important and there are plenty of default
values (see <A HREF="#examples">examples</A>).
<P> 
The possible keywords are:

<H3><A NAME="title"></A> TITLE &lt;title&gt; </H3>
(default: no title)

Title used on the printer output.
&lt;string&gt; - character string up to 75 characters.

<H3><A NAME="mode"></a> MODE  &lt;mode&gt;</H3>
&lt;mode&gt; =  ALL,IRES,ISUB,IMOL or AUTO (default: MODE IRES).
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> ALL  <dd>
for all interatomic distances for chosen residues.

<dt> IRES  <dd>
for interresidual contacts for chosen residues. It is similar 
to 'ALL' except that distances between atoms of different residues 
only will be computed, and distances between main-chain atoms
from adjacent residues are also suppressed. 

<dt> ISUB  <dd>
for intersubunit contacts (subunits must have different
chain names in the Brookhaven file).

<dt> IMOL  <dd>
for intermolecular contacts. This mode requires symmetry
information, see keywords <A HREF="#symmetry"><B>SYMM</B></A> and
<A HREF="#spacegroup"><B>SPACEGROUP</B></A>. The program looks
for contacts using the supplied symmetry operations. If the
symmetry operators are supplied via a spacegroup specification,
then the identity operator is removed. The identity operator
can be specified explicitly using a SYMM card.
<p>
Main-chain to main-chain 
and side-chain to side-chain contacts are suppressed if the atoms are on
the same or adjacent residues <i>and</i> the target symmetry
operation is the identity.

<dt> AUTO  <dd>
as IMOL, but additional (primitive) lattice translations are generated
automatically and combined with the supplied space-group symmetry
in a search for intermolecular contacts. The identity operator is suppressed 
for lattice translations equal to (0,0,0), so that contacts within the same 
asymmetric unit are not listed.
<p>
The default is to use only single translations (<EM>e.g.</EM> +A ,-A,
+A-B ...etc), which works well if the molecule is reasonably
positioned within the cell (not outside). To extend the search to
a larger volume (up to two lattice translations in all directions)
you must also specify the <a href="#bigsearch"><B>BIGSEARCH</B></a>
keyword.

 Note: The 2 Zinc insulin dodecamer requires the symmetry operations
  (in addition to identity)  -X+Y,  -X,  Z and  -Y,  X-Y,  Z, hence
  in the above table of contacts the cutoff at 6Ang for a significant
  oligomer is clear.

</pre>
 Again the cutoff is clear.
<p>
Note: The summation of all atom contacts between symmetry related
molecules excludes water molecules, but includes any other HETATM
labelled atoms.
<p>
Again if there is no spacegroup name on the CRYST1 record of the input
PDB file then the keyword SPACEGROUP can be used.</p>

<h3><A NAME="atype"></a> ATYPE &lt;atype&gt;  (ALL or NON-CARBON)</h3>
(default: ATYPE ALL)
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> ALL   <dd>
all types of atoms will be used in computations. 
<dt> NON-CARBON <dd>
carbon atoms omitted.
</dl>
</blockquote>
<H3><A NAME="amode"></a> AMODE (=ATYPE)   </H3>
<p></p>
<H3><A NAME="spacegroup"></a> SPACEGROUP &lt;spacegroup name&gt;</H3>
followed by the spacegroup name as given in $LIBD/syminfo.lib
<EM>e.g.</EM> 'R 3 :H' or 'H 3' or H3 or 146. Only required when MODE is IMOL 
or AUTO. SYMTitles are automatically generated. The identity operation
is not applied for lattice translations equal to (0,0,0). If no SYMM
or SPAC keyword is given, and symmetry information is required, the
program will attempt to find the spacegroup from the CRYST1 line of the
input PDB file.

<H3><A NAME="bigsearch"></a> BIGSEARCH</H3>
This keyword only takes effect for <a HREF="#mode">MODE AUTO</a>, in
which case it extends the search from +/-1 lattice vector (the default
in MODE AUTO) to +/-2 lattice vectors in every direction (thus searching
a larger volume of space).

<H3><A NAME="symmetry"></a> SYMM &lt;symmetry&gt; </H3>
where &lt;symmetry&gt; is a symmetry operation as in the International Tables.
Only required when MODE is IMOL or AUTO, and more than one card can be
given. If the identity is not explicitly given, it will be automatically
added for lattice translations not equal to (0,0,0). If the identity is
explicitly given, it will be included for all lattice translations 
including (0,0,0).

<H3><A NAME="symtit"></a> SYMTIT  &lt;string&gt;</H3>
(default: 'symmetry n')
<br>
&lt;string&gt; is any meaningful description (up to 15 characters long) 
of symmetries entered on <a href="#symmetry">SYMM</a> cards. SYMTIT cards, 
if present, must be given in the same order as the SYMM cards. 
Example: SYMTIT 21 along a
<P> 
If SYMTIT cards are not supplied, the symmetry description
will be : symmetry 1, symmetry 2, etc...
<p>
If spacegroup symmetry operations are required, and have not been supplied
by the <A href="#spacegroup">SPACEGROUP</a> or <a href="#symmetry">SYMM</a> cards,
then they will be taken from the input PDB file CRYST1 line if they are there. 
SYMMTitles are automatically generated in this case.

<H3><A NAME="angle"></a> ANGLE  &lt;angh&gt; &lt;ango&gt; &lt;dmin&gt; &lt;maxnb&gt; &lt;bmax&gt;</H3>
(default: 120.0 90.0 2.3 4 50.0) Note: &lt;maxnb&gt; is an integer. 
<p>
When using the ANGLE option, the program calculates the hydrogen 
position for those target nitrogen atoms where the hydrogen position
is unambiguous (<EM>i.e.</EM>, excluding NZ on Lys and N terminus). The
angle O...H...N is calculated and printed. For source...oxygen
hydrogen bonds, the angle source...O__Bonded carbon is
calculated. Limits on both these angles (ANGH and ANGO) must be
supplied, and bonds with angles less than these limits are
rejected.
Suitable values are 120 and 90 degrees.
<P> 
The ANGLE option can be used to search for hydrogen bonds within
the protein, and the bond angles will be calculated as described
above. Note that mainchain-mainchain and sidechain-sidechain
contacts within one residue or to an immediately adjacent residue
are suppressed in this mode.                             
The minimum bond length (DMIN) for bonds to be included and the
maximum  number of bonds (MAXNB) are read from the same card, in
free format, as is the MAXIMUM temperature factor for a source atom
to be included in contact search and water analysis (BMAX).
<P> 
An analysis of all water-protein and water-water hydrogen
bonds and the bond angles at the water oxygen is also given.
Note: water residue name should be WAT and the water atom
name must be O (NOT O1 or OW etc) when using this option.
<P> 
The ANGLE option may be used in conjunction with all modes,
but to ensure the numbers are correct (especially the number of 
waters in the first and second hydration shells) the IMOL (or
even better AUTO) mode should always be used, and identity 
(symm x,y,z) included to generate all lattice contacts for analysis
of water interactions (only water molecules should be selected as
the SOURCE range in this case). 
<p>
The ANGLE operation in this version should be the same as the original
with the exception except perhaps as I am not certain about the original 
all waters with occupancy less that 1.0 are excluded from water analysis 
in this version.
<p>
In addition both residue names for waters of HOH or WAT are allowed.</p>
 
<H3><A NAME="hoh"></a> HOH (=ANGLE)</H3>
<H3><A NAME="limits"></a> LIMITS &lt;dmin&gt; &lt;dmax&gt;</H3>
(default: LIMITS 0.0 3.6)        
<blockquote>
<dl>

the minimum distance between atoms to be included in the printout
<dt> &lt;dmax&gt; <dd>
the maximum distance to be printed out. Because of the bricking algorithm
(see <A href="#description">DESCRIPTION</A> section above) some contacts
may be missed if &lt;dmax&gt; is greater than 6.0 A.

<H3><A NAME="hexclude"></a> HEXCLUDE</h3>
Ignore all hydrogen atoms in the input file.
Default is to include them if they are there.

<H3><A NAME="nolist"></a> NOLIST</h3>
Turh off printing of individual contacts and just print overall summary.

<H3><A NAME="source"></a> SOURCE  &lt;n1&gt; [&lt;n2&gt;]</H3>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> n1, n2 <dd>
range of source residues. You may input as many SOURCE cards
as you like (within array limits). The maximum residue number
allowed is 9000. If the range is made of just one residue
only n1 is required.
</dl>

<H3><A NAME="target"></a> TARGET  &lt;n1&gt; [&lt;n2&gt;]</H3>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt> n1, n2 <dd>

as you like (within array limits). The maximum residue number
allowed is 9000 (MXRES). If the range is made of just one
residue only n1 is required.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="fromto"></a>FROM | TO</h3>

Atom selection can also be carried using the keywords FROM and TO
as used in the CCP4 program <a href="distang.html">DISTANG</a>, <EM>i.e.</EM>
allowed inputs are:
<pre>

  (i) based on atom numbers

  FROM ATOM 1 TO 561
  TO ATOM 1 TO 561

  (ii) based on residue numbers but now allowing for chain names

  FROM RESIDUE ALL CHAIN A 1 to 125
  TO   RESIDUE ALL CHAIN W 1 to 256

</pre>
The general input expression is:
<pre>

  FROM [ [ ATOM &lt;inat0&gt; [TO] &lt;inat1&gt; ] | 
          [ RESIDUE &lt;ires0&gt; [TO] &lt;ires1&gt; ]] ...
             [ CHAIN &lt;chainid&gt; ALL | ONS | CA ]
 TO [ [ ATOM &lt;jnat0&gt; [TO] &lt;jnat1&gt; ] | 
          [ RESIDUE &lt;jres0&gt; [TO] &lt;jres1&gt; ]] ... 
             [ CHAIN &lt;chainid&gt; ALL | ONS | CA ]
  
</pre>
If ATOM is specified it is followed by &lt;inat0&gt; and &lt;inat1&gt;,
respectively the first and last target atoms checked. <EM>I.e.</EM> FROM atoms
&lt;inat0&gt; to &lt;inat1&gt; are checked against TO atoms &lt;jnat0&gt; to &lt;jnat1&gt;.
(Atoms are numbered 1 to NAT, in the order read, but the residue order
can be varied without restriction. Beware: atoms with occ=0.0 are not
counted.)
<p>   
If RESIDUE is specified it is followed by &lt;jres0&gt; and &lt;jres1&gt;,
respectively the first and last target residues checked, and
optionally subsidiary keywords:
<pre>
   
 CHAIN &lt;chainid&gt; ALL | ONS | CA
      ALL (default) will select all atoms in the requested residues.
      ONs will select just the oxygen and nitrogen atoms. 
      CA will select just the CA atoms.

</pre>
<EM>i.e.</EM> FROM residues &lt;ires0&gt; to &lt;ires1&gt; are
checked against TO residues &lt;jres0&gt; to &lt;jres1&gt; for the
appropriate class of atoms.
<p>          
Example:
<pre>
   
  will give just source CHAIN A to TARGET CHAIN B

  contact xyzin   /homes/henrick/pdb/pdb4ins.ent &lt;&lt;eof
  LIMITS   2 3.66
  FROM RESIDUE ALL CHAIN A 1 to 21
  TO   RESIDUE ALL CHAIN B 1 to 30
  eof

</pre>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="metal"></a> METAL &lt;Metal&gt; [ &lt;metal-ligand distance&gt; ] </h3>

Metal coordination geometry option. The METAL keyword will automatically
find all atomic distances from all atoms of element type &lt;Metal&gt; to all
other atoms. The element type of the metal is picked up from the ATOM NAME column
in the PDB input file (NOT the element type at the end of the line, which is
only present in newer PDB released entries).
<p>If <a href="#mode">MODE</a> is not specified elsewhere then the use of the METAL
keyword will automatically set the MODE to AUTO, and look for contacts with
symmetry related atoms - in this case the symmetry operations must be
specified in some manner; see the <a href="#mode">MODE</a> keyword for more
details.
<p>
&lt;metal-ligand distance&gt; defaults to a value of 2.35 &Aring;, if not explicitly
specified. Pairs of atoms which are less than this distance apart will be marked
with a "***" symbol (see <A HREF="#comments_on_output">Comments on output</A>).
Use the <a href="#limits">LIMITS</a> keyword to set the closest and furthest
distance for finding contacts, though note that METAL will automatically set
a closest distance of at least 0.25 &Aring;, overriding that set by LIMITS if
it is smaller. 
<p>
The output consists of a list of metal-ligand contacts; for each metal atom
a table of angles is also printed for all those atoms closer than
&lt;metal-ligand distance&gt;. These are the angles at the metal position
formed by each pair of contacting atoms.

<p>
Example 1:
<pre>

  contact xyzin   /homes/henrick/pdb/pdb4ins.ent &lt;&lt;eof
  METAL ZN 2.35
  eof

</pre>
Example 2:
<p> If there is no spacegroup name on the CRYST1 line
in the input PDB file use (or you can still select individual
symmetry operations with SYMMETRY keyword as in the original
contact.f)
<pre>

  contact xyzin   /homes/henrick/pdb/pdb4ins.ent &lt;&lt;eof
  METAL ZN 2.35
  SPACEGROUP R3
  eof

</pre>
This gives the output:

For pdb entry 1kdn the aluminium to ligand contacts are within the same
residue, not between residues, nor are symmetry related contacts involved.
Note that the order of the atoms in the input file is important in this case:

<H2><A NAME="comments_on_output"></A> COMMENTS ON OUTPUT</H2>
<i>Please note: this is not a definitive explanation of the output! See also
individual keyword information for more details of the output associated with
specific keywords.</i>
<p>
The main output of the program is a list of the contacts. The information is
arranged in columns as follows:
<pre>
First three columns: describe the "source" atom
           1 - residue name
           2 - residue number
           3 - atom name
Second three columns: describe the "target" atom
           4 - residue name
           5 - residue number
           6 - atom name
</pre>
In <tt>MODE</tt>s <tt>ALL</tt>, <tt>IRES</tt> and <tt>ISUB</tt> the target atoms
are simply taken from those listed in the input pdb file (limited by the
<tt>TARGET</tt> keyword, if present). In these modes, the next three columns are:
<pre>
           7 - distance between target and source (angstroms)
           8 - hydrogen bond angle (if ANGLE keyword is present)
           9 - "***", "  *"  or "   " (<EM>i.e.</EM> blank)
</pre>
See the comments for keyword <A HREF="#angle">ANGLE</A> above for more details of the contents of
column 8; it will be empty if <tt>ANGLE</tt> is not specified. In column 9, "***"
indicates the strong possibly of a hydrogen bond at this contact (distance &lt; 3.3 A),
"   *" indicates a weak possibility (distance &gt; 3.3 A). Blank indicates that the
program considers there is no possibility of a hydrogen bond. <i>(Nb: when using the
METAL keyword, column 9 instead marks those contacts which lie within the 
&lt;metal-ligand distance&gt;.)</i>
<p>
The final three columns will be empty except in <tt>MODE IMOL</tt> or <tt>AUTO</tt>.
In these cases, the target atoms are generated from those in the pdb file by a
combination of a symmetry operation followed by a lattice translation. These columns
give information about the operations used to create these "symmetry related" atoms: 
<pre>
          10 - lattice translations
          11 - number identifying symmetry operation
          12 - name identifying symmetry operation
</pre>
See the <A HREF="#symmetry">SYMM</A>, <A HREF="#symtit">SYMTIT</A> and <A HREF="#spacegroup">SPACEGROUP</A> keywords for more details
of the number (col. 11) and name (col. 12) of the symmetry operators. Column 10 will
contain output of the form
<pre>          <EM>e.g.</EM>  [  +B-C] or [+A    ].</pre>
Here <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt> and <tt>C</tt> refer to the primitive lattice vectors
<b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> respectively, which are generated from the
<tt>CRYST1</tt> card in the pdb file. So in these two modes, target atoms may seem to
appear more than once - but they will be distinguished by having different associated
symmetry and/or translation operations, which means they are symmetry related to the
atom listed in columns 4-6 but are at different physical positions.
