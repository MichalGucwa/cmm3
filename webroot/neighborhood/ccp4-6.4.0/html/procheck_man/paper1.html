The PROCHECK suite of programs provides a detailed check on the
stereochemistry of a protein structure. Its outputs comprise a number of
plots in PostScript format and a comprehensive residue-by-residue listing.
These give an assessment of both the overall quality of the structure, as
compared with well-refined structures of the same resolution, and also
highlight regions that may need further investigation. The PROCHECK
programs are useful for assessing the quality not only of protein
structures in the process of being solved, but also of existing structures
and those being modelled on known structures.
