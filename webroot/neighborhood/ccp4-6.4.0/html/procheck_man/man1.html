<H1>1. Introduction</H1>

<H2>Aims</H2>

These Operating Instructions describe how to run the <B>PROCHECK</B> suite
of programs (<A HREF="manrefs.html#PROCHECK">Laskowski et al., 1993</A>) for
assessing the &quot;stereochemical quality&quot; of a given protein
structure. The instructions assume that the programs have already been
installed on your computer system. If this is not the case, please refer to
the separate <B>Installation Guide</B> which deals with the installation
procedures for your particular system.

<p>
The aim of <B>PROCHECK</B> is to assess how <B>normal</b>, or conversely
how <B>unusual</B>, the geometry of the residues in a given protein
structure is, as compared with stereochemical parameters derived from
well-refined, high-resolution structures.

<p>
Unusual regions highlighted by <B>PROCHECK</B> are not necessarily
<B>errors</B> as such, but <B>may</B> be unusual features for which there
is a reasonable explanation (<EM>eg</EM> distortions due to ligand-binding
in the protein's active site). Nevertheless they are regions that should be
checked carefully.



<H2>Stereochemical parameters</H2>

The stereochemical parameters used are those described in detail in <A
HREF="manrefs.html#MORRIS">Morris et al. (1992)</A>. These parameters, which
are for the most part not included in standard refinement procedures (and
so are less likely to be biased by them), are listed in <A
HREF="manappa.html#TABLE_A.1">Table 1 of Appendix A</A>.

<p> 
The checks also make use of &quot;ideal&quot; bond lengths and bond angles,
as derived from a recent and comprehensive analysis <A
HREF="manrefs.html#ENGH">(Engh &amp; Huber, 1991)</A> of small molecule
structures in the Cambridge Structural Database, CSD <A
HREF="manrefs.html#CSD">(Allen et al., 1979)</A> - now numbering over
100,000 structures. These &quot;ideal&quot; values are listed in <A
HREF="Appendix_A.html#TABLE_A.2">Table 2 of Appendix A</A>.

<H2>Input</H2>

The input to <B>PROCHECK</B> is a single file containing the coordinates of
your protein structure. This must be in Brookhaven file format (see <A
HREF="manappb.html">Appendix B</A>). One of the by-products of running
<B>PROCHECK</B> is that your coordinates file will be &quot;cleaned
up&quot; by the first of the programs. The cleaning-up process corrects any
mislabelled atoms and creates a new coordinates file which has a
file-extension of <B>.new</B>. The <B>.new</B> file will have the atoms
labelled in accordance with the <B>IUPAC</B> naming conventions <A
HREF="manrefs.html#IUPAC">(IUPAC-IUB Commission of Biochemical
Nomenclature, 1970)</A>.

<p>
<B>Note.</B> At present, hydrogen atoms are ignored. Atoms with zero
occupancy are omitted from the analyses and only the highest occupancy
conformations are retained wherever there are alternate conformations.


<H2>Outputs</H2>

The outputs comprise a number of plots, together with a detailed
residue-by-residue listing. The plots are output in PostScript format <A
HREF="manrefs.html#ADOBE">(Adobe Systems Inc., 1985)</A>, and so can be
printed off on a PostScript laser printer, or displayed on a graphics
screen using suitable software (<EM>eg</EM> <B>GHOSTSCRIPT</B> or
<B>GHOSTVIEW</B> on Sun or Silicon Graphics workstations, or <B>PSVIEW</B>
on Silicon Graphics IRIS-4D systems). The plots can be in colour or
black-and-white and are described in <A
HREF="examples/index.html.html">Sample plots</A>. The residue-by-residue
listing is described in <A HREF="manappd.html">Appendix D</A>.


<H2>Programs</H2>

The suite comprises a number of programs which are described in <A
HREF="manappc.html">Appendix C</A>.
