Residue-by-residue listing for 1abc                                                                                        Page  1

This listing highlights the residues in the structure which may need investigation.

The ideal values and standard deviations against which the structure has been compared are shown in the following table:

                          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ideal value            64.1 183.6 -66.7 177.4 -65.4 -65.3 -39.4   96.8   -85.8    2.0   180.0   -2.0     33.9
     Standard deviation     15.7  16.8  15.0  18.5  11.2  11.9  11.3   14.8    10.7    0.1     5.8    0.8      3.5
                          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the listing below, properties that deviate from these values are highlighted by asterisks and plus-signs. Each asterisk
represents one standard deviation, and each plus-sign represents half a standard deviation. So, a highlight such as +***, indicates
that the value of the parameter is between 3.5 and 4.0 standard deviations from the ideal value shown above.

Where the deviation is greater than 4.5 standard deviations its numerical value is shown; for example, *5.5*.

The final column gives the maximum deviation in each row, while the maximum column deviations are shown at the end of the listing.
Also at the end are the keys to the codes used for the secondary structure and Ramachandran plot assignments.
