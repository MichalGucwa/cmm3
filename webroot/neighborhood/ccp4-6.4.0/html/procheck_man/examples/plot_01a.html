<H1>Ramachandran plot regions</H1>

<p>
The different regions on the <B>Ramachandran plot</B> are as
described in <A HREF="../manrefs.html#MORRIS">Morris et al. (1992)</A>.

<p>
The regions are labelled as follows:

<p>
<PRE>
   <B> A</B>   - Core alpha           <B> L</B>   - Core left-handed alpha   
   <B> a</B>   - Allowed alpha        <B> l</B>   - Allowed left-handed alpha
   <B>~a</B>   - Generous alpha       <B>~l</B>   - Generous left-handed alpha
   <B> B</B>   - Core beta            <B> p</B>   - Allowed epsilon          
   <B> b</B>   - Allowed beta         <B>~p</B>   - Generous epsilon         
   <B>~b</B>   - Generous beta

</PRE>

<p>
The different regions were taken from the observed <B>phi-psi</B>
distribution for <B>121,870</B> residues from <B>463</B> known X-ray
protein structures. The two most favoured regions are the
<B>&quot;core&quot;</B> and <B>&quot;allowed&quot;</B> regions which
correspond to <B>10&#176;</B> x <B>10&#176;</B> pixels having more than
<B>100</B> and <B>8</B> residues in them, respectively. The
<B>&quot;generous&quot;</B> regions were defined by <A
HREF="../manrefs.html#MORRIS">Morris et al. (1992)</A> by extending out by
<B>20&#176;</B> (two pixels) all round the <B>&quot;allowed&quot;</B>
regions. In fact, the authors found very few residues in these
<B>&quot;generous&quot;</B> regions, so they can probably be treated much
like the <B>&quot;disallowed&quot;</B> region and any residues in them
investigated more closely.

<p>
Ideally, one would hope to have over <B>90%</B> of the residues in the
<B>&quot;core&quot;</B> regions. The percentage of residues in the
<B>&quot;core&quot;</B> regions is one of the better guides to the
stereochemical quality of a protein structure.
