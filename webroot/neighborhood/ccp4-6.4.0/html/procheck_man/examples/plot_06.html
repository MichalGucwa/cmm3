<H2>Description</H2>

The various graphs and diagrams on this plot show how the protein's
geometrical properties vary along its sequence. This gives a visualization
of which regions appear to have consistently poor or unusual geometry
(perhaps because they are poorly defined) and which have more normal
geometry.

<p>
The properties plotted are:- 

<UL>

<LI><B>Graphs a-c: Optional properties</B>

<p>
The first three graphs at the top of the page, can be selected from
<B>14</B> possibles by the user. The three default graphs, which are
plotted when you first run <B>PROCHECK</B>, are the first three of:-

<p>
<UL>
       1. Absolute deviation from mean Chi-1 value (excl. Pro)<BR>
       2. Absolute deviation from mean of omega torsion<BR>
       3. C-alpha chirality: abs. deviation of zeta torsion<BR>
       4. Absolute deviation from mean of H-bond energy<BR>
       5. Gamma atom B-value<BR>
       6. Average B-value of main-chain atoms<BR>
       7. Average B-value of side-chain atoms<BR>
       8. <EM>G</EM>-factor for phi-psi distribution<BR>
       9. <EM>G</EM>-factor for chi1-chi2 distribution<BR>
      10. Residue-by-residue <EM>G</EM>-factor<BR>
      11. Approx. accessibility (estimated by Ooi numbers)<BR>
      12. Percentage residue main-chain accessibility<BR>
      13. Standard deviation of main-chain B-values<BR>
      14. Standard deviation of side-chain B-values<BR>
</UL>

<p>
For each graph, <B>unusual</B> values (usually those more than <B>2.0</B>
standard deviations away from the "ideal" mean value) are shown
<B>highlighted</B>.

<p>
<LI><B>Graph d: Secondary structure & average estimated accessibility</B>

<p>
The <B>secondary structure plot</B> shows a <B>schematic</B> representation
of the <B><A HREF="../manrefs.html#KABSCH">Kabsch &amp; Sander (1983)</A></B>
secondary structure assignments. The key just below the picture shows which
structure is which. Beta strands are taken to include all residues with a
Kabsch &amp; Sander assignment of <B>E</B>, helices corresponds to both
<B>H</B> and <B>G</B> assignments, while everything else is taken to be
random coil.

<p>
The shading behind the schematic picture gives an <B>approximation</B> to
the <B>residue accessibilities</B>. The approximation is a fairly crude
one, being based on each residue's <B>Ooi</B> number <A
HREF="../manrefs.html#OOI">(Nishikawa &amp; Ooi, 1986)</A>.  An <B>Ooi</B>
number is a count of the number of other <B>C<em>alpha</em></B> atoms
within a radius of, in this case, <B>14&Aring;</B> of the given residue's own
<B>C<em>alpha</em></B>. Although crude, this does give a good impression of
which parts of the structure are buried and which are exposed on the
surface. Future versions of <B>PROCHECK</B> will include an accurate
calculation of residue accessibility.

<p>
<LI><B>Graph e: Sequence & Ramachandran regions</B>

<p>
The next section shows the <B>sequence</B> of the structure (using the 20
standard one-letter amino-acid codes) and a set of markers that identify
the <B>region </B>of the <B><A HREF="plot_01.html">Ramachandran
plot</A></B> in which each residue is located. There are <B>four</B> marker
types, one for each of the four different types of region: <B>core</B>
(<EM>ie</EM> most favoured), <B>allowed</B>, <B>generous</B> and
<B>disallowed</B>.

<p>
<LI><B>Graph f: Max. deviation</B>

<p>
The small histogram of <B>asterisks</B> and <B>plus-signs</B> shows each
residue's <B>maximum deviation</B> from one of the ideal values given on
the <B><A HREF="../manappd.html">residue-by-residue listing</A></B> in the
<B>.out</B> file. Refer to the final column of the <B>.out</B> file to see
which is the parameter that deviates by the amount shown here.


<p>
<LI><b>Graph g: <em>G</em>-factors</b>

<p>
The shaded squares give a schematic representation of each residue's <A
href="../manappe.html"><b><em>G</em>-factor</b></A> values. (Note
that the <b>chi-1</b> <em>G</em>-factors are shown only for those residues that
do not have a <b>chi-2</b>, and hence no <b>chi1-chi2</b> <em>G</em>-factor).

<p>
Regions with many dark squares correspond to regions where the properties
are "<b>unusual</b>", as defined by a low (or negative)
<em>G</em>-factor. These may correspond to highly mobile or poorly
defined regions such as loops, or may need further investigation.

<H2>Options</H2>

<p>
The main options for the plot are:-

<UL>

<LI>Which 3 of 14 plots to be printed in the 3 main graphs at the top of
the page.

<LI>Number of standard deviations for highlighting outliers (default is
<B>2.0</B>).

<LI>The plot can be in colour or black-and-white.

</UL>

<p>
These options can be altered by editing the parameter file,
<b>procheck.prm</b>, as described <A
href="../parameters/manopt_06.html">here</A>.
