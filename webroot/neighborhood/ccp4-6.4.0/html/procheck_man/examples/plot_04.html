<H2>Description</H2>

The six graphs on the main-chain parameters plot show how the structure
(represented by the solid square) compares with well-refined structures at
a similar resolution. The dark band in each graph represents the results
from the well-refined structures; the central line is a least-squares fit
to the mean trend as a function of resolution, while the width of the band
on either side of it corresponds to a variation of one standard deviation
about the mean. In some cases, the trend is dependent on the resolution,
and in other cases it is not.

<p>
<b>Note</b>. This plot is intended as a <B>rough guide only</B> and too much
reliance should not be placed on getting results that are "better than
structures at the same resolution".

<p>
The 6 properties plotted are: 

<UL>

<LI><B>a. Ramachandran plot quality</B>. This property is measured by the
<B>percentage</B> of the protein's residues that are in the most favoured,
or <B>core</B>, regions of the <A HREF="plot_01.html">Ramachandran
plot</A>.  For a good model structure, obtained at high resolution, one
would expect this percentage to be over <B>90%</B>. However, as the
resolution gets poorer, so this figure decreases - as might be
expected. The shaded region reflects this expected decrease with worsening
resolution.

<p>
<LI><B>b. Peptide bond planarity</B>. This property is measured by
calculating the <B>standard deviation</B> of the protein structure's
<B>omega</B> torsion angles. The smaller the value the tighter the
clustering around the ideal of <B>180</B> degrees (which represents a
perfectly planar peptide bond).

<p>
<LI><B>c. Bad non-bonded interactions</B>. This property is measured by the
<B>number of bad contacts</B> per <B>100</B> residues. Bad contacts are
selected from the list of non-bonded interactions found by program
<B>NB</B> (see <A HREF="../manappc.html#NB">Appendix C</A>). They are defined
as contacts where the distance of closest approach is less than or equal to
<B>2.6&Aring;</B>.

<p>
<LI><B>d. Calpha tetrahedral distortion</B>. This property is measured by
calculating the <B>standard deviation</B> of the <B>zeta torsion
angle</B>. This is a <B>notional</B> torsion angle in that it is not
defined about any actual bond in the structure. Rather, it is defined by
the following four atoms within a given residue: <B>Calpha</B>, <B>N</B>,
<B>C</B>, and <B>Cbeta</B>.

<p>
<LI><B>e. Main-chain hydrogen bond energy</B>. This property is measured by
the <B>standard deviation</B> of the <B>hydrogen bond energies</B> for
<B>main-chain hydrogen bonds</B>. The energies are calculated using the
method of <B><A HREF="../manrefs.html#KABSCH">Kabsch & Sander
(1983)</A></B>.

<p>
<LI><B>f. Overall G-factor</B>. The overall <B><A
HREF="../manappe.html">G-factor</A></B> is a measure of the overall
<B>normality</B> of the structure.  The overall value is obtained from an
average of all the different G-factors for each residue in the structure.
