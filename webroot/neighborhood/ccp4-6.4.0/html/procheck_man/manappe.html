<H1>Appendix E - <em>G</em>-factors</H1>

<p>
The <b><em>G</em>-factor</b> provides a measure of how "<b>normal</b>", or
alternatively how "<b>unusual</b>", a given stereochemical property is.
In <b>PROCHECK</b> it is computed for the following properties:-

<UL>
Torsion angles:-
<UL>
<LI><b>phi-psi</b> combination
<LI><b>chi1-chi2</b> combination
<LI><b>chi1</b> torsion for those residues that do not have a <b>chi-2</b>
<LI>combined <b>chi-3</b> and <b>chi-4</b> torsion angles
<LI><b>omega</b> torsion angles
</UL>

<p>
Covalent geometry:-
<UL>
<LI>main-chain <B>bond lengths</B>
<LI>main-chain <B>bond angles</B>
</UL>

</UL>

<p>
The <b><em>G</em>-factor</b> is essentially just a <b>log-odds score</b>
based on the observed distributions of these stereochemical parameters.

<p>
When applied to a given residue, a <b>low</b> <em>G</em>-factor indicates
that the property corresponds to a low-probability conformation. So, for
example, residues falling in the disallowed regions of the <b>Ramachandran
plot</b> will have a <b>low</b> (or very negative)
<em>G</em>-factor. Similarly for unfavourable <b>chi1-chi2</b> and <b>chi1</b>
values.

<p>
Thus, if a protein has many residues with low <em>G</em>-factors it
suggests that something may be amiss with its overall geometry.

<p>
<H2>Torsion angle <em>G</em>-factors</H2>

<p>
For the <B>torsion angle</B> <b><em>G</em>-factors</b>
the standards of "<b>normality</b>" have been derived from an
analysis of <b>163</b> non-homologous, high-resolution protein chains
chosen from structures solved by <b>X-ray crystallography</b> to a
resolution of <b>2.0&Aring;</b> or better and an <b><em>R</em>-factor</b>
no greater than <b>20%</b>. No two of the <b>163</b> chains shared a
sequence homology greater than <b>35%</b>, and all atoms having <b>zero
occupancy</b> were excluded from the analysis.

<p>
The analyses provided the <b>observed</b> distributions of <b>phi-psi</b>,
<b>chi1-chi2</b>, <b>chi-1</b>, <b>chi-3</b>, <b>chi-4</b> and <b>omega</b>
values for each of the <b>20</b> amino acid types. These distributions were
then divided into <b>cells</b>. For example, each residue type's
<b>Ramachandran plot</b> of <b>phi-psi</b> values was divided into
<b>45</b> x <b>45</b> cells. The numbers of observations in each cell were
used to calculate the <b>probability</b> of a given residue type having a
given <b>phi-psi</b> combination. The probabilities were, in turn, used to
compute a <b>log-odds score</b> for each cell. Log-odds scores can be
summed, rather than multiplied like probabilities; therefore, taking
meaningful averages becomes possible.

<p>
<H2>Bond-length and bond-angle <em>G</em>-factors</H2>

For the main-chain <b>bond lengths</b> and <b>bond angles</b>, the
<em>G</em>-factors are computed using the <A

and standard deviations.
