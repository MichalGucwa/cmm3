<H1>2. How to run PROCHECK</H1>

To run <B>PROCHECK</B>, type the following:-

<p>
<UL>
<B>procheck</B>  <EM>coordinate_file [chain-ID]  resolution</EM>
</UL>
where:

<UL>

<LI><EM>coordinate_file</EM> is the name of the file containing your
protein structure and should include the full path unless the file is in
the default directory. The file must be in Brookhaven format (see <A
HREF="manappb.html">Appendix B</A>).

<p>
<LI><EM>[chain-ID]</EM> is an optional parameter used for multiple chain
files when only one of the chains is to be analysed. If all chains are
required, or the file only contains a single chain, you omit this
parameter. Otherwise enter the single-letter chain ID of the chain to be
analysed.

<p>
<LI><EM>resolution</EM> is the <B>resolution</B> at which the structure has
been determined. If the resolution is unknown or not relevant (<EM>eg</EM>
for structures solved by <B>NMR</B>) enter any resolution (<EM>eg</EM>
<B>2.0</B>).

</UL>

<p>
For example, to run the check on the Brookhaven file <EM>1abc</EM>, which
was solved to <B>2.4&Aring;</B> you might enter:

<p>
<UL>
<B>procheck  /data/pdb/p1abc.pdb  2.4</B>
</UL>


<H2>Running just the plotting programs</H2>

The <B>PROPLOT</B> script runs just the plotting programs that generate the
output PostScript files. It skips the programs that calculate the data, and
so is much faster than running <B>PROCHECK</B> all over again. (Of course,
the calculation programs need to have been run at least once so that all the
required data files are present).

The script is particularly useful if you want to regenerate some, or all,
of the plots, perhaps with different plot parameters in the
<B>procheck.prm</B> file (see <A HREF="man5.html">Customizing the
<B>PROCHECK</B> plots</A>).

<p>
To run <B>PROPLOT</B>, enter:

<p>
<UL>
<B>proplot</B> <EM>coordinate_file  [chain-ID]  resolution</EM>
</UL>

<p>
where the parameters are the same as before.


<H2>Running in batch-mode on a VAX</H2>

On VAX computers, you can submit the entire process to a batch queue by
entering:-

<p>
<UL>
<B>prosub</B>  <EM>coordinate_file  [chain-ID]  resolution  queue-name  default-directory</EM>
</UL>

where the first three parameters are as before, and:

<UL>

<LI><EM>queue-name</EM> is the name of the batch-queue to which you want the job
submitted.

<p>
<LI><EM>default-directory</EM> is the directory to which the files created by
<B>PROCHECK</B> are to be written. Note, this need not be the same
directory as the one containing the structure file, but it must be one to
which you have write access.

</UL>

<p>
If you just type <B>prosub</B> you will be prompted for each of these
<B>5</B> parameters in turn. If you do not want to specify a <B>chain
ID</B>, leave this entry blank.
