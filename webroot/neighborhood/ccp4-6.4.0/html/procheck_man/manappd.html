<H1>Appendix D - Residue-by-residue listing</H1>


An example of a residue-by-residue listing is given <A
HREF="examples/print.out">here</A>. The different parts of it are described
in detail below. Some of the key figures are shown on a separate <A
HREF="examples/1abc.sum">summary page</A>.


<H2><A NAME="Part1">Part 1. Residue information</A></H2>

The first part of the residue-by-residue listing (the <B>.out</B> file)
deals with a number of stereochemical parameters, as will be described
below.

<p>
<B><A HREF="examples/print_0.out">Explanatory notes.</A></B>
The first page gives some explanatory notes
about the stereochemical parameters used. These notes include the
&quot;ideal&quot; values, and corresponding standard deviations, against
which the values calculated for your structure are compared.  The
&quot;ideals&quot; used here come from an analysis of 118 high-resolution
structures performed by <A HREF="manrefs.html#MORRIS">Morris <EM>et
al.</EM> (1992)</A>, and are listed in Table 1 of <A
HREF="manappa.html">Appendix A</A>.

<p>
Note that, the printing of this explanatory text can be suppressed, if
required, by amending the parameter file <B>procheck.prm</B> (see <A
HREF="man5.html">Customizing the PROCHECK plots</A>).

<p>
<B><A
HREF="examples/print_1.out">Residue-by-residue information.</A></B>
The explanatory text is followed by an analysis of each of the
stereochemical parameters for each residue in the structure. Each value is
highlighted by asterisks and plus-signs if it deviates from the
&quot;ideal&quot; by more than 1 standard deviation. An <B>asterisk</B>
represents <B>one</B> standard deviation, and a <B>plus-sign</B> represents
<B>half</B> a standard deviation. So, a highlight such as <B>+***</B>
indicates that the value of the parameter is between <B>3.5</B> and
<B>4.0</B> standard deviations from the ideal.  Where the deviation is more
than <B>4.5</B> standard deviations, its numerical value is shown instead:
for example, <B>*5.5*</B> represents <B>5.5</B> standard deviations.

<p>
The appearance of the listing can be altered to some extent by editing
the parameter file <B>procheck.prm</B> (see <A HREF="man5.html">Customizing
the PROCHECK plots</A>). This allows you to show, say, only the asterisks
and not have the values themselves printed. You can also include only those
values that are more than a given number of standard deviations from the
ideal.

<p>
The information shown for each residue is as follows:

<p>
<DL>
<DT>
1. <B>Residue number</B></B> <DD> as given in the original coordinates
file.

<DT>
2. <B>Chain identifier</B> <DD> where relevant, picked up from the original
coordinates file.

<DT>
3. <B>Sequential number</B> <DD> starting at 1 for the first residue and
numbering the residues sequentially from then on. This may differ from the
residue numbering given in the original coordinates file.

<DT>
4. <B>Kabsch &amp; Sander secondary structure assignment</B> <DD>
assignment of secondary structure according to the method of <A
HREF="manrefs.html#KABSCH">Kabsch &amp; Sander (1983)</A>. The codes used
are as follows:

<PRE>
    B - residue in isolated beta-bridge    S - bend                   
    E - extended strand, participates      T - hydrogen-bonded turn   
        in beta-ladder                     e - extension of beta-strand
    G - 3-helix (3/10 helix)               g - extension of 3/10 helix
    H - 4-helix (alpha-helix)              h - extension of alpha-helix
    I - 5-helix (pi-helix)             

</PRE>

The lower-case assignments are our extensions of the Kabsch &amp; Sander
definition and are obtained by slightly relaxing their criteria.

<DT>
5. <B>Region of Ramachandran plot</B> <DD> a single letter code identifies
which region of the Ramachandran plot the residue is in. For end residues
and glycines this assignment does not apply, so is shown by a hyphen, `-'.
The other codes are as follows:

<PRE>
     A - Core alpha          L - Core left-handed alpha  
     a - Allowed alpha       l - Allowed left-handed alpha
    ~a - Generous alpha     ~l - Generous left-handed alpha
     B - Core beta           p - Allowed epsilon         
     b - Allowed beta       ~p - Generous epsilon        
    ~b - Generous beta      XX - Outside major areas     
                                 (ie disallowed)

</PRE>
<DT>
6. <B>Chi-1 dihedral angle</B> <DD> three separate columns are given for
the three possible conformations of chi-1: gauche minus, trans, and gauche
plus.

<DT>
7. <B>Chi-2 dihedral angle</B> <DD> only the values for the chi-2 dihedral
angles in the <B>trans</B> conformation are shown.

<DT>
8. <B>Proline phi</B> <DD> the phi torsion angle for proline residues only.

<DT>
9. <B>Phi helix</B> <DD> the phi torsion angle for all residues identified as being
in an alpha-helix by the H of the Kabsch &amp; Sander secondary structure
assignment code.

<DT>
10. <B>Helix psi</B> <DD> as above, but for the psi torsion angle.

<DT>
11. <B>Chi-3 dihedral angle</B> <DD> being the torsion angle defined by the S-S
bridge in a disulphide bond, with separate columns for the right- and
left-handed conformations.

<DT>
12. <B>Disulph bond</B> <DD> sulphur-sulphur distance, in A, between paired cysteine
residues.

<DT>
13. <B>H-bond en.</B> <DD> estimated strength of the main-chain hydrogen
bond (in kcal/mol), where applicable, calculated using the method of <A
HREF="manrefs.html#KABSCH">Kabsch &amp; Sander (1983)</A>.

<DT>
14. <B>Chirality C-alpha</B> <DD> value of the zeta &quot;virtual&quot;
torsion angle, defined by the atoms Calpha, N, C, and Cbeta. This is a
&quot;virtual&quot; torsion angle as it is not defined along an actual
bond.

<DT>
15. <B>Bad contacts</B> <DD> number of bad contacts for this residue, as
defined by non-bonded atoms at a distance of &lt;= 2.6A. The bad contacts
are listed at the end of the print-out (see Part 3 below).

<DT>
16. <B>Max dev</B> <DD> this shows the maximum deviation (in terms of asterisks, etc)
of all the columns in the current row.

</DL>
At the end of this print-out, the column totals show the maximum deviation
in each column, the column's mean value and standard deviation, and number
of values it contains. If the mean values themselves deviate significantly
from the &quot;ideals&quot;, they too are highlighted by asterisks.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="Part2">Part 2. Main-chain bond lengths and bond angles</A></H2>

The <A HREF="examples/print_2.out">second part of the listing</A> analyses the main-chain bond lengths and
bond angles of your protein structure. As before, any deviations in the
actual bond-lengths and bond angles from the &quot;ideal&quot; values are highlighted
with asterisks and plus signs.

<p>
At the end of this print-out, the different bond lengths and bond angles
are summarised in two tables giving the minimum, maximum, and mean values
of each type, together with their standard deviations.

<p>
The &quot;ideal&quot; values used are given at the head of the listing
(though the printing of these can be suppressed by amending the parameter
file procheck.prm). The ideals are as determined from the analysis of
small-molecule data by <A HREF="manrefs.html#ENGH">Engh &amp; Huber
(1991)</A> and are shown in Table 2 of <A
HREF="manappa.html#TABLE_A.2">Appendix A</A>.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="Part3">Part 3. Bad contacts listing</A></H2>

The <A HREF="examples/print_3.out">bad contacts listing</A> shows the
atom-pairs involved, the type of contact, and the separation between the
two atoms. As already mentioned, bad contacts are defined here as any pair
of non-bonded atoms that are at a distance of <B>&lt;=2.6&Aring;</B> from
one another.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="Part4">Part 4. Summary statistics and quality assessment</A></H2>

The <A HREF="examples/print_4.out">final part of the print-out</A>
reproduces the statistics printed on Plots 1, 4 and 5 (<A
HREF="examples/index.html">Sample Plots</A>). It also gives an overall
assessment of the structure's quality using the <A
HREF="manrefs.html#MORRIS">Morris <EM>et al.</EM> (1992)</A> stereochemical
classification scheme. Here a number from <B>1</B> to <B>4</B> is assigned
to the structure for each of three separate stereochemical parameters
(<B>1</B> being the best and <B>4</B> the worst score). Finally, it prints
an analysis of the various overall <EM>G</EM>-factors calculated for the
structure. Any <EM>G</EM>-factors below <B>-1.0</B> may indicate properties
that need to be investigated more closely.
