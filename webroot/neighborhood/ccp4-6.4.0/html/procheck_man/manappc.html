<H1>Appendix C - Program descriptions</H1>

<H2><A NAME="CLEAN.F">Program 1. CLEAN.F</A></H2>

<B>Written by: D K Smith &amp; E G Hutchinson. Modified: R A Laskowski</B>

<p>
The first of the programs is called <B>CLEAN</B>. Its purpose is to produce
a cleaned-up version of your coordinates file.  The new file is given a
<B>.new</B> extension and is used by the other programs in the suite for
the calculation of the stereochemical parameters.

<p>
The cleaning-up process involves a number of checks. The first one ensures
that the atoms in your structure have been correctly labelled in accordance
with the <B>IUPAC</B> naming conventions (<A
HREF="manrefs.html#IUPAC">IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature,
1970</A>).

<p>
A typical error is that the <B>Neta1</B> and <B>Neta2</B> atoms of arginine
are labelled the wrong way round. This error is corrected by the
program. Also corrected are atom labels for <B>Phe</B>, <B>Tyr</B>,
<B>Asp</B> and <B>Glu</B> residues. Thus, for example, the carbon atom in
tyrosine labelled <B>Cdelta1</B> is the one that gives the lowest
<B>chi-2</B> torsion angle.

<p>
The program switches atom labels when they are in error and shows the
old atom names in a column at the right of the <B>.new</B> file.

<p>
The program also checks that the correct <B>L/D</B> stereochemical
assignments have been made on individual residues, and corrects any errors
found.

<p>
All other errors are merely flagged in the <B>.new</B> file and
described in the <B>clean.log</B> file. Also listed in <B>clean.log</B>
are: chain breaks, unknown residues, and missing atoms. Chain breaks are
defined as locations where the distance between two adjacent Calpha atoms
is greater than <B>5.0&Aring;</B>. Residue atoms on one side of such a
break are marked with a <B>`&gt;'</B> in the <B>.new</B> file while the
atoms of the residue on the other side are marked with a <B>`&lt;'</B>.

<p>
Atoms with alternate locations have only the location with the highest
occupancy retained in the <B>.new</B> file. The alternate positions are
written to the .new file, but are flagged: <B>ATOM</B> records are marked
as <B>ATALT</B> and <B>HETATM</B> records as <B>HEALT</B>. Atoms with zero
occupancy are flagged as <B>ATZERO</B> and <B>HEZERO</B>. None of the
flagged atoms are included in the stereochemical checks.

<p>
Finally, residues with unusual values of the &quot;notional&quot;
<B>zeta</B> dihedral angle (defined by the four atoms:
<B>Calpha-N-C-Cbeta</B>) are marked with an asterisk in the .new file. The
value of this angle should be &gt; <B>23</B> degrees and &lt; <B>45</B>
degrees.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="SECSTR.F">Program 2. SECSTR.F</A></H2>

<B>Written by: D K Smith. Modified: R A Laskowski</B>

<p>
The second program in the suite is <B>SECSTR</B> which calculates all
the required torsion angles, main-chain hydrogen-bond energies, and
secondary structure assignments. This information is written out to the
<B>.rin</B> file for use by the plotting programs.

<p>
The hydrogen-bond energies and the secondary structure assignments are
calculated using the method of <A HREF="manrefs.html#KABSCH">Kabsch &amp;
Sander (1983)</A>.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="NB.C">Program 3. NB.C</A></H2>

<B>Written by: D T Jones &amp; D Naylor</B>

<p>
The third program in the suite is called <B>NB</B>. It identifies all
non-bonded interactions between different pairs of residues in the protein
structure. These are defined where the closest atom-atom contact between
two residues is less than <B>2.0&Aring;</B> and the atoms concerned are
<B>4</B> or more bonds apart.

<p>
All such closest contacts are written out to the <B>.nb</B> file for
use by the plotting programs.

<p>
<B>Note that</B>, only intra-chain contacts are stored - inter-chain
contacts are not considered.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="ANGLEN.F">Program 4. ANGLEN.F</A></H2>

<B>Written by: R A Laskowski</B>

<p>
The fourth program in the suite is called <B>ANGLEN</B>. It calculates
all the main-chain bond lengths and bond angles in the structure. These are
written out to the <B>.lan</B> file. Also calculated are the <B>RMS</B>
distances from a best-fit plane for all planar sidechain groups. These
comprise the <B>aromatic rings</B> of Phe, Tyr, Trp and His, and the
<B>end-groups</B> of Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln and Glu. The coordinates of the
atoms in the planar groups are written out to the <B>.pln</B> file.

<p>

<H2><A NAME="OTHER">Programs 5-7. TPLOT.F, PPLOT.F and BPLOT.F</A></H2>

<B>Written by: R A Laskowski &amp; M W MacArthur</B>

<p>
The last 3 programs in the suite are the plotting programs which create
the plots and the residue-by-residue listing for your structure. The plots
and listing have a number of user-definable options which are held in the
parameter file <B>procheck.prm and</B> which can be changed simply by
editing the file using any text editor (see <A HREF="man5.html">Customizing
the PROCHECK plots</A>). The plots are described in <A
HREF="examples/index.html">Sample plots</A>, and the print-out is
described in <A HREF="manappd.html">Appendix D</A>.
