<H1> XDLMAPMAN (CCP4: Deprecated Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>xdlmapman </b>
- X-windows tool; manipulation, analysis and reformatting of electron density maps.
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>xdlmapman</b> 
[-font1 | font2 | font3 | font4 | font5]
<br>
  [menu-driven command selection; interactive parameter input]

<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>

  xdlmapman can be used to read, write, analyse and manipulate
  electron-density maps from most biomacromolecular refinement
  packages, as well as from/for CCP4, PHASES and O.
<p>
  The program runs in interactive mode only.  It uses the XDL_VIEW
  toolkit of J.W. Campbell to provide an easy-to-use interface.
  Commands are selected by clicking on the desired menu option.
  Map formats are selected with pop-up menus; all other parameters
  are set in pop-up dialogue boxes (cut-and-paste is supported).
  In most cases, default values are given in [square brackets].
  To accept these defaults, hit the RETURN key.  If multiple numbers
  are to be input (e.g., cell constants), and if only the first one
  needs to be changed, for instance, typing the new value for this
  first number followed by the RETURN key will preserve the values
  for the other five numbers.
<p>
  There is a command line option (-font?) which will determine the
  size of the menu font. These fonts refer to the xdl fonts which are
  defined from 1 to 5. This can be useful if the window size is too
  large for the screen. The default font size is 2. The font definitions
  can be changed in the .Xdefaults file or xrdb, however all xdl
  programs will be then be effected.
<p>
  Output from the program is written to a separate area of the main
  window.  Output can be scrolled and cut and pasted into other
  documents.
<p>
  For lengthy operations a progress bar shows how much of the
  operation has been completed.

<H2> HISTORY</H2> 
  xdlmapman is a CCP4 special version of MAPMAN (part of the Uppsala
  RAVE averaging package).  This version is entirely interactive and
  has a user-friendly interface.  However, this version can only handle
  one map at a time, and some of the functionality of the parent
  program is absent.
<p>
  MAPMAN was originally written as a simple format-exchange program,
  to convert X-PLOR maps to CCP4 format etc.  It has grown quite a
  bit to handle many types of map, to include MAPPAGE functionality
  (previously provided as a stand-alone program from Uppsala), and
  to perform skeletonisation (also previously provided as a stand-alone
  program from Uppsala) and peak-picking.
<p>
  Many (parts of) routines were written by other people including
  Soren Thirup, Morten Kjeldgaard, Wolfgang Steigemann and Phil Evans.

<H2> MENU OPTIONS</H2> 
  Commands are issued by moving the pointer over the desired menu
  option and clicking with the left mouse button.

<H3>  READ A NEW MAPFILE</H3>

  Provide the name of the file and then select the appropriate
  file type from the pop-up menu.  See <a href="#formats">FORMATS</a>.

<H3>  LIST MAP STATISTICS</H3>

  This prints some information and statistics pertaining to the
  map that is currently in memory.

<H3>  MOMENTS OF THE MAP</H3>

  This calculates and lists statistical moments of the map (average,
  standard deviation, skewness and curtosis).

<H3>  MULTIPLY MAP BY A FACTOR</H3>

  All density values will be multiplied by the number provided (if
  this number is not equal to zero or one).

<H3>  DIVIDE MAP BY A FACTOR</H3>

  All density values will be divided by the number provided (if
  this number is not equal to zero or one).

<H3>  PLUS SOME VALUE</H3>

  The number provided (if unequal zero) will be added to all density
  values.

<H3>  SCALE THE MAP TO A RANGE</H3>

  The map is scaled such that all electron density values lie inside
  the range of numbers provided (e.g., -100 to +100).

<H3>  ZERO PARTS OF THE MAP</H3>

  All density values which lie outside the range provided are set
  to zero.

<H3>  NORMALISE THE MAP</H3>

  The map will be scaled such that the average density is zero and the
  standard deviation ("sigma") is one.

<H3>  UVW</H3>

  The axis-order in which the map is written is changed according
  to the input by the user.  For example, to write out XY sections
  with Y varying fastest, then X and then Z, use UVW = 2 1 3.

<H3>  SPACEGROUP OF THE MAP</H3>

  The spacegroup *number* will be set to the number provided.  For
  example, to change the spacegroup to P212121, the number 19 would
  be entered.

<H3>  CELL CONSTANTS</H3>

  The cell constants can be edited.  This is normally not a good idea.
  The only exception is when a map is read with a format that does not
  precisely enough reproduce the cell constants (e.g., integer*2 DSN6
  maps).  In such cases, angles of 90.0 degrees are sometimes converted
  to 89.9998.

<H3>  BONES SKELETONISE</H3>

  This is the Thirup & Jones implementation of Greer's electron density
  skeletonisation algorithm.  A base level (e.g., 1.5 * sigma) and a
  step size (e.g., sigma) need to be provided.
  This command would normally be followed by BONES WRITE (quod vide).
  the reason to separate the two is to enable (1) experimentation with
  different skeletonisation parameters without having to write out the
  BONES file, and (2) experimentation with parameters of the BONES WRITE
  command without a need to redo the skeletonisation.

<H3>  BONES WRITE</H3>

  Transform the skeletonised density into a set of BONES suitable for
  use in O.  Provide the filename, skeleton name and a cut-off length
  to partition bones into main-chain and side-chain fragments.

<H3>  PROD_PLUS FOR MAPPAGE/BRIX</H3>

  With this command the value of Prod and Plus for MAPPAGE and BRIX
  can be changed.  These values are normally set such that the entire
  range of density can be captured by the integer*2 format of DSN6
  maps.

<H3>  RANGE FOR MAPPAGE/BRIX</H3>

  Instead of supplying Prod and Plus for MAPPAGE and BRIX, the desired
  range of density values which should be covered in a DSN6 map can be
  supplied.  The program will use this range to calculate appropriate
  values for Prod and Plus.

<H3>  MAPPAGE FILE</H3>

  This produces a DSN6 map ("mini-map") suitable for use with O.  The
  map is in binary DSN6 format, using one byte per density value.

<H3>  BRIX FILE</H3>

  This produces a BRIX map ("mini-map") suitable for use with O.  The map
  is in binary character format, which means that it can head inspected
  (using Unix commands such as cat, head, or more).  In particular, the
  header record can be inspected in this fashion.

<H3>  SWAPBYTES</H3>

  This command takes an existing DSN6 map file which was created on a
  VAX, swaps the bytes, and then writes the new records back to the
  *same* file.

<H3>  WRITE MAP</H3>

  Provide the name of the file and then select the appropriate
  file type from the pop-up menu.  See <a href="#formats">FORMATS</a>.

<H3>  PICK PEAKS</H3>

  With this command, peaks above a certain level and in a user-defined
  part of the map can be picked.  They are written out as a PDB file
  containing dummy water molecules (in fact, water oxygen atoms).
  The algorithm is the same as that used to pick peaks in 2D and 3D
  NMR spectra (see <a href="#references">REFERENCES</a>).

<H3>  DELETE CURRENT MAP</H3>

  Remove the current map from memory.

<H3>  HELP</H3>

  This prints some brief information.  Subsequently, click on *any*
  menu command to get a brief explanation of what that command does.

<H3>  QUIT</H3>

  Stop working with the program.
