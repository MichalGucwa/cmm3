<h1>RWBROOK: (CCP4: Library)</h1>
<h2> NAME</h2>
<b> rwbrook</b>
- Library Subroutines for handling the co-ordinate working format

<h2><a name="newlibrary"</h2>NOTE ON NEW VERSION</H2>

From CCP4 5.0, co-ordinates are handled by the MMDB C++ class library.
MMDB provides an interface to Fortran (see the source file 
<tt>mmdb_rwbrook.cpp</tt>). This is wrapped by a thin version
of <tt>rwbrook.f</tt> which is intended to be backwardly-compatible
with the previous Fortran-only version of <tt>rwbrook.f</tt>.
Existing Fortran applications should be able to link with the
new <tt>rwbrook.f</tt> with no changes.
<p>
In practice, there are some minor changes to how <tt>rwbrook.f</tt>
behaves:
<ol>
<li><b>XYZADVANCE and ANISOU records.</b><br>
The original <tt>rwbrook.f</tt> returned data from an ANISOU line in
a separate call to XYZADVANCE/XYZATOM/XYZCOORD. Applications needed
to check whether returned data was from an ATOM line or an ANISOU line.
The new <tt>rwbrook.f</tt> returns all data for an atom in one call,
including the anisotropic U if an ANISOU line followed the ATOM line.
The old checks in applications can be removed, although in the normal
formulation it is safe to leave them since they check for zero x, y and z
values as well.
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="description"> DESCRIPTION</A></H2>
This document describes the library routines that handle co-ordinate files
e.g. reading and writing plus extraction of data to application programs.
The current mechanism is that the each identified line is read from the file
and the data placed in an internal buffer. Routines then extract the data from 
the buffer and pass it to the application program. The current format that is 
in use is based on the PDB version 2.1 draft format, see
<a href="pdbformat.html">separate description</a>.

<h2><li><a name="part2int">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
This part describes how to use the RWBROOK libraries to handle co-ordinate 
data. It will not be a complete account of all the possible instances that
may arise but all the routines are described <a href="#part2des"> below</a>. 
<p>
It may seem a bit strange that simple functions such as CLOSE and REWIND 
are operated through a specific subroutine. In the future the working format 
may change, however it is hoped that procedures set out in this part will be 
independent of the format. 
<p>
The old subroutines have been kept to ensure backwards compatibility. The 
compatibility is not absolute however, for instance XYZOPEN or XYZOPEN2 
should still be used to open the co-ordinate file. Also, RWBROOK and WBROOK 
should only be used with orthogonal co-ordinates and not fractional ones.
</li>

<h2><li><a name="part2sub">THE SUBROUTINES</A></h2>
Firstly, the various COMMON blocks must be initialised before reading and 
writing of files occurs (the COMMON blocks are described 
<a href="#part2com">below</a>. This is done using <a href="#xyzinit">
XYZINIT</a>, it is called once from the top of the program.
<p>
All co-ordinate files should be opened with <a href="#xyzopen">XYZOPEN</a> 
or in special cases <a href="#xyzopen2">XYZOPEN2</a>. 
The FORTRAN channel number can be assigned automatically. If this is done then
it is best that all other files have their channel numbers assigned 
automatically as well. CCPDPN has been altered to make this easy.
<p>
It is also good practice to close all opened files before the program 
terminates normally. <a href="#xyzclose">XYZCLOSE</a> is the subroutine 
that will close the co-ordinate file.
<p>
The header information from the file is read when the file is opened. This
includes the cell, orthogonalisation matrices (and in the future the symmetry).
These are then stored in COMMON blocks which then should be extracted by 
subroutine calls rather than inclusion of the COMMON blocks in the main 
program.
<p>
If the cell is  present in the file then the matrices for converting between 
fractional coordinates and orthogonal coordinates in the standard setting 
will  be  calculated. If the orthogonalisation matrix is present in the file 
then the co-ordinates need not be in a standard setting.
<p>
<a href="#xyzadvance">XYZADVANCE</a> has a dual purpose in that it 
reads/writes data from/to the file into/out of an internal buffer. If the 
record name is recognised then the data is stored in the buffer. Otherwise 
the line is ignored but could be echoed to an output file (see the second 
example). <a href="#xyzatom">XYZATOM</a> and 
<a href="#xyzcoord">XYZCOORD</a> then extract the data from the buffer and 
pass it to the calling program.
</li>

<h2><li><a name="part2exa"> EXAMPLE OF USING THE LIBRARY ROUTINES</A></H2>

This example simply reads a PDB file assigned on XYZIN. There is no output 
file.

<p>
Here is a further example which reads and writes a file. A set of coordinates 
are read in and processed. The input file is then re-read and an  output  file
is created with the updated coordinate data. Notice that all the header 
records plus any REMARK cards will be echoed to the output file because of 
the second call to XYZADVANCE.

      <a name="rwbfin">SUBROUTINE</a> RWBFIN(IUN,IOUT)
C     ===========================
C
C_BEGIN_RWBFIN
C
C       This subroutine copies remaining lines straight from input to
C output.
C
C_END_RWBFIN

These routines are now obsolete but are here to maintain backwards 
compatibility with the version of RWBROOK that was in version 3.2 of CCP4.

      SUBROUTINE RBINIT(IUNIT)
C     ========================
C
C_BEGIN_RBINIT
C
C      This routine is obsolete and should be removed. Initialises various
C COMMON block variables and rewinds the file.
C
C_END_RBINIT
C




      SUBROUTINE RBROOK(IUNIT,ISER,ATNAM,RESNAM,CHNNAM,IRESN,RESNO,IS,
     *X,Y,Z,OCC,B,IZ,IOUT,MSG1,MSG2,ITER,*,*)
C     ================================================================
C
C_BEGIN_RBROOK
C
C      This subroutine is obsolete and should be removed. May be
C PROBLEM in that routine returns orthogonal coordinates and not fractional
C ones. It presents a combination of XYZADVANCE, XYZATOM and XYZCOORD. The 
C arguments IS, MSG1 and MSG2 are redundant
C
C_END_RBROOK
C




      SUBROUTINE WBROOK(IUNIT,ISER,ATNAM,RESNAM,CHNNAM,IRESN,IS,
     *X,Y,Z,OCC,B,IZ)
C     ================================================================
C
C_BEGIN_RBROOK
C
C      This subroutine is obsolete and should be removed. May be
C PROBLEM in that routine does not cater for IS.
C
C_END_RBROOK
C





      SUBROUTINE RBFRAC(A,B,C,AL,BE,GA,MSG)
C     =====================================
C
C_BEGIN_RBFRAC
C
C       This routine is obsolete and should be removed. The argument
C MSG is redundant.
C
C_END_RBFRAC
C




      SUBROUTINE CVFRAC(X,Y,Z,XX,YY,ZZ,IFLAG,MSG)
C     ===========================================
C
C_BEGIN_CVFRAC
C
C       Another silly obsolete routine that really should be deleted.
C MSG value is in fact useless. Library output controlled by CCPERR.
C
C_END_CVFRAC
C




      SUBROUTINE SFREAD(ID,NG,A,B,C,IWT,IELEC,CU,MO,IFAIL,IFILFF)
C     ===========================================================
C
C_BEGIN_SFREAD
C
C       Obsolete routine should be deleted. IFILFF not used.
C
C_END_SFREAD
C



      SUBROUTINE RWNOHEAD()
C     =====================
C
C_BEGIN_RWNOHEAD
C
C	This subroutine resets the logical variable IFHDOUT in the RWBROOK
C     common block RBRKXX, and should be called once before either
C     XYZADVANCE or WBCELL in order to prevent those routines from writing
C     headers to an output pdb file.
C     Effectively we are fooling the library that the header has already
C     been written.
C
C_END_RWNOHEAD
