<b><h2><A NAME="introduction">Introduction</A></h2></b>

FINDNCS is a program which automatically finds Non-Crystallographic
Symmetry (NCS) operations from heavy atom sites, in order to facilitate
applying averaging technique in the MIR/MAD procedure. The program outputs 
NCS operations (a rotation matrix and translation vector), RMS, polar angles 
and screw distance, matching sites and other useful information for users. 
Optionally, the program can also generate some files so that NCS operations 
can be displayed by the O program automatically.
<p>
The program requires at least 6 heavy atom sites for each NCS
one operations unit <EM>i.e.</EM> at least 3 sites for each NCS asymmetric unit
(which can be a protein monomer, dimer, trimer or even higher oligomer).
Once the coordinates of the sites were input, they were extended
by crystallographic symmetry and lattice repetition. Then the program
systematically searches whether a group of sites can match another group of
sites by an NCS operation. There are a number of criteria to choose one NCS operation 
among crystallographic symmetric related ones:
<OL>
<LI>Number of matching sites is maximum</LI>
<LI>Screw distance of the NCS operation is minimum</LI>
<LI>Center of the two group sites are closest</LI>
<LI>Radius of the group of atoms are minimum</LI>
</OL>
Once all the independent NCS have been found, they are ranked 
by these criteria. 
<p>
In some cases, for example, when the number of sites is low enough (less 
than 20), the space group is simple (such as triclinic, monoclinic, R3, P3),
and/or the NCS relations are regular (like 222 tetramer 2-fold dimer and
so on) users can run the program fully automatically and accept the suggestions 
from the output. However, if users have high symmetry, many HA sites or
many protein molecules with non-regular NCS relations, they have to 
follow the instructions in this manual to find the NCS step by step. 
Alternatively, users can also define the search range (which includes 
the entire oligomer of the protein) themselves using knowledge from the 
solvent flattening map. Otherwise, it might take long CPU time and or 
the results are too complicated to understand. For details, please read 
through <b><A HREF="#keywords">Key Word Command</a></b> and <b><A HREF="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></b> of this document.

General: Each line which starts with "!" or "#" will be ignored. The possible keywords are:
<blockquote>
<A HREF="#cell"><B>CELL</B></A>, <A HREF="#compound"><B>COMPOUND</B></A>,
<A HREF="#disp"><B>DISP</B></A>, <A HREF="#error"><B>ERROR</B></A>,

</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="cell"></A>CELL &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;alpha&gt;
&lt;beta&gt; &lt;gamma&gt; </H3>

It is necessary to specify cell dimensions when the
coordinates of the HA sites are in the fractional system or the HA sites 
have not been
put into a correct asymmetric unit. This command must be given before 
SPACEGROUP, SITE and FSITE commands.

<H3><A NAME="spacegroup"></A>SPAcegroup  &lt;NAME&gt; </H3>   
Space group name or number,  <EM>e.g.</EM> P212121 or 19. 
If this command is not present, the program will not operate
crystallographic symmetry and so it only works properly when you already
put the HA sites in a correct asymmetric unit.

<H3><A NAME="error"></A>ERRor	&lt;error&gt; 	</H3>	
Estimated error of heavy atom site.
If the distance between two sites after a NCS operation is less than this 
value, the program will think these two sites join the NCS. I recommend 
to start with 1/2 of the resolution used by difference PATTERSON/FOURIER 
which solved the HA sites. 

<H3><A NAME="maxncs"></A>MAXNCS &lt;maxncs&gt; </H3> 
Example MAXNCS 20  [default: all the solutions] 
Maximum number of NCSs output in the final output files. If the command 
is not present, the program will output all the ranked solutions. 
Usually (I think in more than 99% cases), the solution(s) with highest 
rank are the correct one. 

<H3><A NAME="compound"></A>COMPound &lt;compound&gt;	</H3>
Default compound name.
The compound name of given sites followed this by command will be assumed to
come from this compound unless otherwise specified.
The name to let the program distinguish HA sites from different
compound. If two heavy atoms (even from different compound) can bind same 
site of  different NCS related protein molecules but are given different 
compound name, the program will not  use them to calculate NCS operations 
In this case, opportunity to find the correct NCS might be missed. But on the 
other hand, if two sites come from different compound by are not given the 
same, it might give a lot of false &quot;noise&quot; and so it will take longer CPU time
to find the correct solution.

<H3><A NAME="fsite"></A>FSITE  &lt;fx&gt; &lt;fy&gt; &lt;fz&gt;  [&lt;compound&gt;] </H3> 
Fraction coordinates and compound name
<pre>
	example: fsite   0.755   0.282   0.146 
	     or	 fsite   0.689   0.467   0.299   PCMB 
</pre>
if the compound name is not given, the program will assume the  
name is the same as the default name from <A HREF="#compound">COMPOUND</A>. CELL command must be 
given before this command. 

<H3><A NAME="site"></A>SITE   &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; [&lt;compound&gt;]</H3>
Orthogonal coordinates and compound name
<pre>
	examples	site -13.752  16.271  27.267	
</pre>
if the compound name is not given, the program will assume the 
name is the same as the default name from <A HREF="#compound">COMPOUND</A>. See
<A HREF="#convention_orthogonal_system">convention of the orthogonal system</A>. If the coordinates are already
put into the correct asymmetric unit, user does not have to give cell
dimension and space group.

<H3><A NAME="frclim"></A>FRCLIM &lt;xfrclow&gt; &lt;xfrchigh&gt; &lt;yfrclow&gt; &lt;yfrchigh&gt; 
&lt;zfrclow&gt; &lt;zfrchigh&gt;</H3>
Fractional xyz limit for search ranges
<pre>
	example -1. 1.  -1. 1.  -1. 1.
</pre> 
By default, the program extends HA sites to 8 unit cells (XYZ from -1. 
to 1.), to make sure that the search range includes the entire protein
molecule. However, if users have many crystallographic operations,
(like cubic, hexagonal or tetragonal), it is extremely time consuming
to find out in such a range and there are a lot of chances to have
&quot;noise&quot; (false NCS). So, users have to determine a smaller search 
range themselves (see <A HREF="#faq4a">FAQ 4.a</A>). 
This command can be repeated.
See also <A HREF="#xyzlim">XYZLIM</A> and <A HREF="#sphere">SPHEre</A>

<H3><A NAME="xyzlim"></A>XYZLIM &lt;xlow&gt; &lt;xhigh&gt; &lt;ylow&gt; &lt;yhigh&gt; &lt;zlow&gt; &lt;zhigh&gt;</H3>
Orthogonal xyz limit for search ranges
<pre>
     example -10 50  -100  40  -20  60
</pre>
This command can be repeated; see <A HREF="#frclim">FRCLIM</A> 

<H3><A NAME="sphere"></A>SPHEre &lt;cenx&gt; &lt;ceny&gt; &lt;cenz&gt; &lt;radius&gt;</H3> 
Search sphere.
Sites which are located inside a sphere with given center position and 
radius will be used for NCS search.
This command can be repeated. See <A HREF="#frclim">FRCLIM</A>.

<H3><A NAME="disp"></A>DISP  &lt;maxdisp&gt;  &lt;axislength&gt; </H3> 
&lt;MAXDISP&gt; maximum number of sites for graphics displaying,
&lt;axislength&gt;  length of the axis displayed by the O program.
This command is for generating PDB files and certain files 
used by the O program (Jones et al 1990) to automatically display the
results in graphics. For details see <A HREF="#faq3">FAQ 3</A>.

<H3><A NAME="minmatch"></A>MINMATCH &lt;minmatch&gt;</H3> 
Minimum site match number.
If you have many sites or crystallographic symmetry operations, program
will find many false NCS. This command will make the output much
cleaner and can also speed up the calculation.

<H3><A NAME="list"></A>LIST &lt;yes&gt; | &lt;no&gt; </H3> 
If yes, some detailed information will be output before the final solution found out.

<b><h2><A NAME="conventions">Conventions and example output</a></h2></b>

<pre>
<A NAME="convention_orthogonal_system"></A> The program uses following convention for orthogonal system
                             X is in A direction
                             Y is in AB plane
                             Z is perpendicular to AB plane

 Each NCS operation can be described as that an object
 rotate kappa degree about a certain axis, then move a
  screwing distance along the direction of this axis

 In the following for each possible NCS, the program provides:
 Matching pairs: number of matching pairs by the possible NCS solutions
                  is ranked by this number
 Matching members: the ID number of each site (from input order before
                   crystallographic operation)
 RMS:  root mean square deviation of the superimposed sites
 Screw: the screwing distance
 Radii: average distance between center and all joining site
 Polar angles:  they describes the NCS axis as follow
  psi is the angle between Z and NCS axis
  phi is the angle between X and image of NCS axis XY plane
  kappa is the rotation angle. 180=2fold, 90=4-old ... so on
  the polar angle definition is same as in the POLARRFN program
 Center: center position of all the joining sites, this
        can help to find out if two axis interact each other

<b><h2><A NAME="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h2></b>

<b><A NAME="faq1"></A>1) If I can find NCS real operation from heavy atom sites manually,
is it sure the program can find it too?</b><br>
Yes!
<p>
<b><A NAME="faq2"></A>2) Can I directly use the NCS matrix from FINDNCS in averaging programs?</b><br>
It depends on the circumstance of protein oligomers. For example,
if you only have a dimer AB in crystallography asymmetric unit (asu), the 
program can easily find the NCS from A to B (or B to A). However, if you have
tetramer ABCD, the program will give you the NCS matrix A_to_B, A_to_C,
A_to_D, B_to_C, B_to_D and C_to_D, with total 6 matrices while in
most averaging programs you probably only need first 3 matrix. However, your 
tetramer is in 222 symmetry, A_to_B/D_to_C should be the same matrix, so 
is A_to_C/B_to_D, A_to_D/B_to_C. The program in this case will only
output 3 matrix which you can use in the averaging program.
<p>
Sometimes the program does not output the NCS which you want, for
example biologically, ABCD is the tetramer biologically, the program can
give NCS A_to_B and A'_to_F' where A' and F' are crystallographically 
equivalent to A and F. You can find it when you try to make the mask
before averaging. You can use <A HREF="#sphere">SPHERE</A> and <A HREF="#xyzlim">XYZLIM</A> or <A HREF="#frclim">FRCLIM</A>.
<p>
Although FINDNCS does not always give you the exact NCS operation required
by averaging programs, it is still much much faster to find out the correct
NCS using the program as a tool than find NCS by hand. 
<p>
<b><A NAME="faq2a"></A>2.a) How should I analyse the output of FINDNCS?</b><br>
Look at the graphics using the outpdb files and O files.<br>
>From the log output.<br>
For example, you find the following output shows a dimer of 2-fold
symmetry. The joining sites 1-fit-4 and 2-fit-3.... after the 180 deg NCS 
operation. (only in two fold symmetry, site 1 fit 4 and while 4 also fit 1
in the same NCS)

>From the matching site number, you can find this is a perfect 222 NCS
symmetry only from the output. Of course it will be much easier to understand 
if you look at graphics using the PDB files (and O files if you use O).

<p>
<b><A NAME="faq3"></A>3) How to display the results by graphics?</b><br>
<p>
If the <A HREF="#disp">DISPLAY</A> command is present, the program will generate some files for
graphics display. First, it generates a PDB file ncsall.pdb which
include all the sites within the search range. After NCSs have been
found, the program will generate ncs1.pdb ncs2.pdb ..... which
includes sites joining operations of NCS1, NCS2 ... and so on. You can
use any graphics program to display them.
<p>
In the case you use O and/or RAVE:<br>
The program also generates a file called ncs.ofm which include NCS
operators, and vectors which can be used by the O program. Then program
will make an O macro file called oncs.mac (together with ncs1.mac, ncs2.mac...). 
If users run O under the same directory and type @oncs.mac, there will be 
a group of commands appearing in menu bar (@ncs1.mac, @ncs2.mac). If
you want to display first NCS operations found by FINDNCS, click
@ncs1.mac the O program will display a axis and the sites which join the
NCS in yellow and  sites superimposed by this NCS. 
After running @oncs.mac The NCS matrix is stored as <br>
.lsq_rt_ncs1
.lsq_rt_ncs2
....
If you have bones, you can display as two objects (<EM>e.g.</EM> SKEL and SKEL1)
If you want to see how the 1st NCS works type:<br>
lsq_obj ncs1 SKEL to see how it is superimpose to SKEL1
If you have a electron density call map1, you can use command:<br>
lsq_rt_obj .lsq_rt_ncs1 map1 to superimpose this map.
If you  edit the file oncs.mac to take out  .lsq_rt_ncs1... to a new file,
it can be directly used by the RAVE packages.
<p>

<b><A NAME="faq4"></A>4) What should I do in the case the program takes an intolerable CPU time?</b><br>
The time of the program is proportional to N*N*N*N*(N-1), where N 
is the total number of search sites after crystallographic operations. If 
this number is more than 300, the calculation will become very slow (10 hours
in a DEC-alpha for 310 atoms, so about 300 hours for 620 atoms). If users 
use an automatic mode for XYZ limit (8 unit cells XYZ from -1 to 1), this 
number can be found in the following line<br>
        736 sites are extended to maximum cells
<p>
In this case users have to use smaller search range defined by commands
<A HREF="#frclim">FRCLIM</A>, <A HREF="#xyzlim">XYZLIM</A> or <A HREF="#sphere">SPHERE</A>. (The sites number inside selected range can be
found in the line:
         148 sites are inside the selection ranges	)<br>
Increasing <A HREF="#minmatch">MINMATCH</A> is also the way to substantially 
decrease the CPU time when too many possible solutions are found. If the 
program output is something like this<br>
Solution: 1000    Max match:   16<br>
i1,i2,i3,j1,j2,j3   1  83  91  57 115  67     CPU time:   103.0 s<br>
Solution: 2000    Max match:   16<br>
i1,i2,i3,j1,j2,j3   4  47  76  58  36  85     CPU time:   379.2 s<br>
You find out that the maximum matching number is 16 so setting minmatch to 6 
should not hurt anything.

<b><A NAME="faq4a"></A>4.a) How should I define the search range?</b><br>
The idea of defining a search range is to include at least one entire
protein oligomer so the program would not miss the correct NCS. If a search 
range includes  8 crystallographic ASU homogeneously in XYZ directions, I think
(not proved) an entire protein oligomer won't be missed
in more than 95% cases.
<p>
It does not matter if the search range includes more than one
entire protein oligomer. (The program should be able to recognize
the crystallographic symmetric equivalent NCSs by finding the joining sites
of these NCSs are crystallographic equivalent too.) However, too big a
search range might cause many sites to be searched and slow down the
search. It is not very practical if the sites inside the range are
more than 300.
<p>
There are several ways you can decide the search range.
<ul>
<li>According the knowledge of ASU in a particular space group. <BR>
It is quite complicated to find a search range for a certain 
spacegroup to guarantee an entire protein oligomer is included . 
At this point, the author has not been clear for all the spacegroups<BR>
I only recommend for some individual cases :<BR>
 --In triclinic, monoclinic, P3x, and R3 space groups, user can use
    the default search range of the program.<BR>
 -- Space group P2x2x2x, (-0.5,1. -0.5.1, -0.5,1)<BR>
 -- Space group P4x2x2, (0. 1.  0. 1.  0. 1)<BR>
Klas Anderson pointed out that the search should be performed according 
to the corresponding Cheshire group of the space
group. This is tabulated by Hirschfeld Acta Cryst. A (1968) and 
in Int. Tables of Cryst. (I have not checked myself)
If any one has more knowledge about this, please tell me.
<li>Use <A HREF="#list">LIST yes</A> and <A HREF="#disp">DISPLAY</A> Option <br>
You can use default search range first. The &quot;LIST yes&quot; would list 
all the NCS it finds. Since there are a lot of repetitions in the default
search range, the correct one must appear after the program running 
for a while (10-60 minutes CPU perhaps). If your log file is
called findncs.log, you can type the command:<br>
"grep MATCH findncs.log | sort +6" and you will get something like
<pre>
 MATCH #           3 with matching pairs           5
 MATCH #           4 with matching pairs           5
 MATCH #          15 with matching pairs           5
  ........
 MATCH #        1585 with matching pairs          12
 MATCH #        1569 with matching pairs          13
 MATCH #         681 with matching pairs          14
 MATCH #        1070 with matching pairs          14
</pre>
Now you know the best match so far is MATCH 681. You open the file
findncs.log and find MATCH 681 and you can find NCS there. The atom
file ncsall.pdb has been generated and you can use graphics to see what
this NCS looks like and choose the search range round the joining
sites.
<li>According the bones of the electron density or solvent flattening mask<BR>
Even if you don't want to use averaging technique, you have to look at
the electron density and bones and decide which crystallographic ASU you
are going to use. This ASU should certainly include at least one protein
oligomer. You do not have to operation the heavy atom sites to this ASU.
If you just express the range by <A HREF="#xyzlim">XYZLIM</A>, <A HREF="#frclim">FRCLIM</A> or <A HREF="#sphere">SPHERE</A>, the program
should find out the NCS very quickly.
