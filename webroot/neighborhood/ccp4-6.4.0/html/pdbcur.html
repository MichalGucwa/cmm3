<H1> PDBCUR (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>pdbcur </b>
- a curation tool providing various analyses and manipulations of PDB files
<p>
<H2> SYNOPSIS</H2>
<b>pdbcur xyzin</b>
<i>foo_in.pdb</i>
<b>xyzout</b>
<i>foo_out.pdb</i>
<br>
 [Key-worded input file]
<p>

<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>

<tt>pdbcur</tt> provides various functions for analysing and manipulating
the contents of PDB files. The program is written using the new MMDB
library for coordinate data, and thus works with a hierarchical view
of the atomic model. This hierarchy is visible for example in the
<a href="#atom_selection">atom selection syntax</a> used. 
<p>
The program works on each keyword in turn. Therefore, the behaviour
of a keyword <em>may</em> depend on what keywords have been previously
applied, and how they have updated the model. In complex cases, it
may be better to perform several runs of <tt>pdbcur</tt>.

<H2> INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
<H3> XYZIN</H3>
Input coordinate file.

<H3> XYZOUT</H3>
Output coordinate file.

<H2> KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>

<h3><a name="summarise">summarise   </a></h3>
Summarise the contents of the coordinate file. For each chain in each model, 
the following information is listed:
<ul>
<li>The total number of residues
<li>The set of residue ranges
<li>The number of residues which have alternative conformations
<li>The amino acid composition
</ul>

<h3><a name="delsolvent">delsolvent </a></h3>
<p>Delete all solvent residues from all chains and all
models. The list of residues identified as "solvent" is
kept in $CCP4/lib/src/mmdb/mmdb_tables.cpp as array
StdSolventName, and is currently "ADE", "CYT", "GUA", 
"INO", "THY", "URA", "WAT", "HOH", "TIP", "H2O", "DOD", 
"MOH".</p>
<p>If a chain has both
protein and solvent, only solvent gets removed. If a chain
becomes empty after removal of solvent, it gets removed.</p>

<h3><a name="delhydrogen">delhydrogen </a></h3>
Delete all hydrogens in the model. This is simple wrapper
to delatom.

<h3><a name="mostprob">mostprob [ &lt;altID&gt; ] </a></h3>
Keep only the most probable alternate conformation, i.e.
that with the highest occupancy, irrespective of ordering
and altID label. Other conformations are deleted from the
model. For the kept atoms, the occupancy is set to 1.0
and the altID removed. Note that the resetting of occupancies
renders a subsequent 'cutocc' keyword ineffective.
<p>
If there are two conformations with occupancy of 0.5, then
the conformation with alternate ID &lt;altID&gt; is kept.
If this parameter is not given, it defaults to "A". Note that
this only applies to equal dual conformers - for unequal
conformers, that with the highest occupancy is kept, as explained
above.
<p>
This option is useful for switching back and forth between single 
and multiple conformers during refinement to check the validity of 
the model, and for generating single models for simulation or
modelling.

<h3><a name="cutocc">cutocc      {cutoff}</a></h3>
Delete all atoms with an occupancy less than or equal
to {cutoff}. The default cutoff is 0.0, i.e. specifying
cutocc with no arguments removes all atoms with zero
occupancy.

<h3><a name="cutocc">noanisou </a></h3>
Removes all the ANISOU records from the coordinate file.

<h3><a name="renchain">renchain    {selection of chain(s)}    'new chain ID'</a></h3>
Example:  renchain  /*/A 'B' <br>
Quotations are optional and are useful for designation 'no chain ID'. <br>
Examples:
<ul>
<li>rename A to 'no chain ID': renchain A ''
<li>rename 'no chain ID' to B: renchain /*// B
</ul>

<h3><a name="renresidue">renresidue  {selection of residue(s)}  'new residue name'</a></h3>
Example:  renresidue  (ALA) 'AL1' 

<h3><a name="renatom">renatom     {selection of atom(s)}  'new 4-letter atom name'</a></h3>
Example:  renatom  CA[C] ' CC '

<h3><a name="renelement">renelement  {selection of atom(s)}  'new element name'</a></h3>
Example:  renelement  CA[C] 'AL'

<h3><a name="delmodel">delmodel    {selection of model(s)}</a></h3>
Deletes the specified model(s). <br>
Example (delete model #1):                delmodel /1 <br>
Example (delete all models with chain A): delmodel /*/A

<h3><a name="delchain">delchain    {selection of chain(s)}</a></h3>
Deletes the specified chain(s). <br>
Example (delete chain A in all models):   delchain A <br>
Example (delete chain A in 1st model):    delchain /1/A

<h3><a name="delresidue">delresidue  {selection of residue(s)}</a></h3>
Deletes the specified residue(s). <br>
Example (delete residues 33 to 120):      delresidue  33-120

<h3><a name="delatom">delatom     {selection of atom(s)}</a></h3>
Deletes the specified atom(s). <br>
Example (delete all C-gamma atoms):       delatom CG[C]

<h3><a name="deldist">deldist  &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; &lt;R&gt; </a></h3>
Deletes atoms within R angstrom of x,y,z. <br>
Example:   deldist 32.1 45.6 -0.4 10.0

<h3><a name="lvmodel">lvmodel     {selection of model(s)}</a></h3>
Leaves the specified model(s), everything else is deleted. <br>
Example (leave only model #1):            lvmodel /1 <br>
Example (leave all models with chain A):  lvmodel /*/A

<h3><a name="lvchain">lvchain     {selection of chain(s)}</a></h3>
Leaves the specified chain(s), everything else is deleted. <br>
Example (leave chains A in all models):    lvchain A <br>
Example (leave only chain A in 1st model): lvchain /1/A

<h3><a name="lvresidue">lvresidue   {selection of residue(s)}</a></h3>
Leaves the specified residue(s), everything else is deleted. <br>
Example (leave residues 33.A to 120.B): lvresidue 33.A-120.B

<h3><a name="lvatom">lvatom      {selection of atom(s)}</a></h3>
Leaves the specified atom(s), everything else is deleted. <br>
Example (leave only C-alpha atoms):       lvatom "CA[C]:*" <br>
Note the use of * to get all alternative conformations, since the
default for atom-level selection is a blank alt loc indicator
only, see <a href="#atom_selection">atom selection syntax</a>.

<h3><a name="lvdist">lvdist  &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; &lt;z&gt; &lt;R&gt; </a></h3>
Leaves atoms within R angstrom of x,y,z; everything else is deleted. <br>
Example:   lvdist 32.1 45.6 -0.4 10.0

<h3><a name="write">write       {PDB|CIF|BIN}</a></h3>
Writes 'xyzout' as a PDB, mmCIF or MMDB BINary
file. By default, the file is written in the format
of input file.

<h3><a name="genter">genter  </a></h3>    
No parameters; this keyword generates PDB 'TER' cards.

<h3><a name="sernum">sernum      </a></h3>
No parameters; this keyword generates correct atom
serial numbers.

<h3><a name="mvsolvent">mvsolvent   </a></h3>
No parameters; moves solvent chains to the end of models.

<h3><a name="symmetry">symmetry  &lt;spgname&gt;  </a></h3>
Input of the space group symmetry name, e.g. 'P 21 21 21'
(without quotation marks, spaces _are_ significant, case sensitive).
This parameter is mandatory if coordinate file does not
specify the space group symmetry.

<h3><a name="geometry">geometry &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;c&gt; &lt;alpha&gt; &lt;beta&gt; &lt;gamma&gt;</a></h3>
Input of the unit cell dimensions (space-separated
real numbers). This parameter is mandatory if coordinate
file does not specify the cell parameters.

<h3><a name="genunit">genunit     </a></h3>
Generating a unit cell as defined by crystallographic
information given in coordinate file or set up with
keywords 'symmetry' and 'geometry'. Chains generated
by identity operation retain their names, all other
are renamed as c_n, where c is the chain's original
name, and n is the number of symmetry operation in
the space group used (starting from 0 for identity
operation on). In order to comply with PDB standards,
the chains are then to be renamed using renchain
command, e.g.  renchain A_2 H . The chains may be
assigned automatically generated 1-character names
using the command  mkchainIDs .
<p>
Example: rnase.pdb contains 2 chains A and B.
Generate a unit cell, space group P 21 21 21, 4
symmetry operations, and assign chain IDs C,D,E for
chain A transformed by operations #1,2,3, and IDs
F,G,H for chain B transformed by the same operations.
Chains A and B transformed by 0th operation (identity)
retain their IDs:
<pre>

pdbcur xyzin rnase.pdb xyzout ucell.pdb &lt;&lt;eof
? symm P 21 21 21
? genu
? renc A_1 C
? renc A_2 D
? renc A_3 E
? renc B_1 F
? renc B_2 G
? renc B_3 H
? eof

</pre>

<h3><a name="symop">symop  X,Y,Z 'old chain ID' 'new chain ID' 'old ID' 'new ID' ...</a></h3>
Declares (but does not apply) a symmetry operation.
The symmetry operations for each X,Y,Z fractional
coordinates must be written without spaces.
   Pairs 'old chain ID' - 'new chain ID' specify how
the chains should be renamed after operation. This
input is not mandatory. If no renaming is specified,
the newly generated chains will be renamed automatically
(see keyword symcommit).
<p>
   Example:  symop  Y+1/2,X-1/2,Z  A S  B R  <br>
(declare symmetry transformation x=Y+1/2, y=X-1/2, z=Z
with renaming chain A to S and B to R.

<h3><a name="symcommit">symcommit   </a></h3>
No parameters. <br>
Applies all symmetry operations declared since
last symcommit statement. First operation (normally
identity) will be applied to the existing set of
coordinates, all other will be applied to the
duplicates of the coordinates, and the results
are merged.
<p>
   The newly generated chains are named as C_n,
where C is the original chain name, and n is the
symmetry operation number. Symmetry operations
are numbered as they appear in symop statements,
from 0 on; however the very first one is applied
to the existing chains, which are not renamed in
this case.
<p>
   Example:
<pre>

pdbcur xyzin rnase.pdb xyzout rnase1.pdb &lt;&lt;eof
? symop  X,Y,Z
? symop  Y+1/2,X-1/2,Z
? symcommit
? eof

</pre>

just adds two chains named A_1 and B_1, obtained
according to the rule Y+1/2,X-1/2,Z from chains
A and B, to the existing file.

<h3><a name="mkchainIDs">mkchainIDs  </a></h3>
Automatically generates 1-character chain IDs after
applying symmetry operations. The IDs are generated
such that they use all available letters starting
from A, and a chain is not renamed if its name is
already a 1-character one.
<p>
The following example
<pre>

pdbcur xyzin rnase.pdb xyzout ucell.pdb &lt;&lt;eof
? symm P 21 21 21
? genu
? mkch
? eof

</pre>
produces exactly the same result as that given for
keyword GENUNIT, because the original chains are named
sequentially as A,B (not G,I, for example).

<h3><a name="rotate">rotate      {selection of atoms} alpha beta gamma x y z</a></h3>
<h3><a name="rotate">rotate      {selection of atoms} alpha beta gamma center</a></h3>
Euler rotation of selected atoms through angles alpha,
beta and gamma (degrees) as applied to the initial
Z-axis, new Y-axis and newest Z-axis, correspondingly.
The rotation center is given by either orthogonal
coordinates x, y and z or by keyword 'center' for
specifying the mass center of the selected atoms.
<p>
   Examples:
<pre>

 1. 90-degree rotation of chain A about Z-axis in
    original coordinate system:
    rotate   A   90 0 0   0 0 0
 2. 60-degree rotation of chains A and B about Y-axis
    in the coordinate system of their mass center:
    rotate 'A,B'  0 60 0   center

</pre>

<h3><a name="translate">translate   {selection of atoms} frac tx ty tz</a></h3>
<h3><a name="translate">translate   {selection of atoms} orth tx ty tz</a></h3>

Translate selected atoms through tx ty tz, which can be
in fractional or orthogonal coordinates, depending on
subkeyword 'frac' or 'orth'.

<h3><a name="vrotate">vrotate     {selection of atoms} alpha vx vy vz   x y z</a></h3>
<h3><a name="vrotate">vrotate     {selection of atoms} alpha vx vy vz   center</a></h3>
<h3><a name="vrotate">vrotate     {selection of atoms} alpha atom1 atom2</a></h3>
Rotation of selected atoms through angle alpha (degrees)
about a vector given by direction (vx,vy,vz) from the
rotation center (given as x,y,z or by keyword 'center'
for the mass center of the selected atoms). The vector
may also be specified by two atoms atom1 and atom2
represented in the mmdb selection notation.
<p>
   Examples:
<pre>

 1. 90-degree rotation of chain A about Z-axis in
    original coordinate system:
    vrotate  A   90  0 0 1   0 0 0
 2. 60-degree rotation of chains A and B about Y-axis
    in the coordinate system of their mass center:
    vrotate 'A,B'  60  0 1 0  center
 3. 45-degree rotation of all atoms about vector connecting
    C-alpha atoms of residues 20.A of chain A and 55
    of chain B:
    vrotate /*/*/*/* 45  /1/A/20.A/CA[C] /1/B/55/CA[C]
    or, if there is only one model in the PDB file:
    vrotate *  45  A/20.A/CA[C] B/55/CA[C]

</pre>

<h2><a name="atom_selection">ATOM SELECTION SYNTAX</a></h2>

Specification of the selection sets:
<dl>
<dt><em>either</em> 
<dd> /mdl/chn/s1.i1-s2.i2/at[el]:aloc
<dt><em>or</em> 
<dd> /mdl/chn/*(res).ic/at[el]:aloc
</dl>
<p>
where no spaces are allowed. The slashes separate the
hierarchical levels of models, chains, residues and atoms.
<p>
Notations:
<pre>

 mdl   - the model's serial number or 0 or '*' for any model
         (default).
 chn   - the chain ID or list of chain IDs like 'A,B,C' or
         '*' for any chain (default).
 s1,s2 - the starting and ending residue sequence numbers
         or '*' for any sequence number (default).
 i1,i2 - the residues insertion codes or '*' for any
         insertion code. If the sequence number other than  
         '*' is specified, then insertion code defaults to ""
         (no insertion code), otherwise the default is '*'.
 res   - residue name or list of residue names like 'ALA,SER'
         or '*' for any residue name (default)
 at    - atom name or list of atom names like 'CA,N1,O' or
         '*' for any atom name (default)
 el    - chemical element name or list of chemical element
         names like 'C,N,O', or '*' for any chemical element
         name (default)
 aloc  - the alternative location indicator or list of
         alternative locations like 'A,B,C', or '*' for any
         alternate location. If the atom name and chemical
         element name is specified (both may be '*'), then
         the alternative location indicator defaults to ""
         (no alternate location), otherwise the default is
          '*'.

</pre>
Values for chain IDs, residue names, atom names, chemical element
names and alternative location indicators may be negated by
prefix '!'. For example, '!A,B,C' for the list of chain names
means 'any chain ID but A,B,C'.
<p>
Generally, any hierarchical element as well as the selection
code may be omitted, in which case it is replaced for
default (see above). This makes the following examples valid:
<pre>

 *                   select all atoms
 /1                  select all atoms in model 1
 A,B                 select all atoms in chains A and B in
                     all models
 /*/1,2              select all atoms in chains 1 and 2 in
                     all models. Note that you must use this 
                     format with numerical chain identifiers
 /1//                select all atoms in chain without chainID
                     in model 1
 /*/,A,B/            select all atoms in chain without chainID,
                     chain A and B in all models
 33-120              select all atoms in residues 33. to 120.
                     in all chains and models
 A/33.A-120.B        select all atoms in residues 33.A to
                     120.B in chain A only, in all models
 A/33.-120.A/[C]     select all carbons in residues 33. to
                     120.A in chain A, in all models
 CA[C]               select all C-alphas in all
                     models/chains/residues
 A//[C]              select all carbons in chain A, in all models
 (!ALA,SER)          select all atoms in any residues but
                     ALA and SER, in all models/chains
 /1/A/(GLU)/CA[C]    select all C-alphas in GLU residues of
                     chain A, model 1
 /1/A/*(GLU)./CA[C}: same as above
 [C]:,A              select all carbons without alternative
                     location indicator and carbons in alternate
                     location A

</pre>
 NOTE: if a selection contains comma(s), the selection sentence must
be embraced by quotation marks, which indicate to the input parser that
the sentence is a single input parameter rather than a set of comma-
separated arguments.
