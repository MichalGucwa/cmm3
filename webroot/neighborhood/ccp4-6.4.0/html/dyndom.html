<p>
For complete and up-to-date information, see the 
<a href="http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/dyndom">
DynDom Home Page</a>.

<p>
DynDom is a program that determines protein domains, hinge axes and
amino acid residues involved in the hinge bending. It is fully
automated.

<p>
You can use DynDom if you have two conformations of the same
protein. These may be two X-ray structures, or structures generated
using simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics or normal mode
analysis.

<p>
The application of DynDom provides a view of the conformational change
that is easily understood. The conformational change may be quite
complicated in detail, but by using DynDom you can visualize it as
involving the movement of domains as quasi-rigid bodies. The analysis
of a conformational change in terms of domain movements only makes
sense if the interdomain deformation is at least comparable to the
intradomain deformation. You can use DynDom to access this, but the
results could be misleading if this is not the case.

<H2><a name="files">INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</a></H2>

<H3> Input</H3>
<dl compact>
<dt>command_file
<dd>The name of the command file should be given as the sole argument to dyndom.
This file specifies the PDB file names, chain identifiers, if they exist, 
and the control parameter settings (see <a href="#control">below</a> and
<A HREF="#examples">examples</A>).
<dt>Two PDB files
<dd>The names of the two PDB files containing the two conformations should
be given in the command file.
</dl>

<H3> Output</H3>
<dl compact>
<dt>foo_info
<dd>A file that gives all the relevant information on the conformational 
change in terms of domain motions.
<dt>foo_pdb
<dd>An pdb-formated file that gives the coordinates of atoms from both chains.
The conformation of the first is as it is in its original PBD file.
The second chain has been repositioned such that its "fixed" domain is
superposed on the fixed domain of the first. "Arrow molecules" are
at the end of this file and depict the interdomain screw axes. The residue
at the centre of each segment of the sliding window has written in the
B-factor column of the first chain, the absolute rotation (in radians) of the segment.
One can visualise this by selecting "Temperature" from the "Colours" menu in RasMol.
<dt>foo_rotvecs
<dd>A rotation vector file in PDB format for display using RasMol. 
Each "atom" is located at a point whose coordinates are the components of the
rotation vector representing the rotation of a particular backbone segment. 
The number of atom gives the number of the residue at the centre of
the backbone segment. 
<dt>foo_rasscript
<dd>A RasMol script file for display of the protein, its domains, its
interdomain screw axes and residues involved in the interdomain motion.
The first conformation will be coloured according to domain and bending region,
whilst the second is left grey or white. This file can also used to display
the rotation vectors. 
<dt>foo_dihedral
<dd>A dihedral analysis file that compares dihedral angle changes in the bending regions. 
</dl>
To display the rotation vectors using RasMol, simply enter the command: 
<pre>

 rasmol foo_rotvecs -script foo_rasscript 

</pre>
To display the protein to view the domains etc, simply enter the command: 
<pre>

 rasmol foo_pdb -script foo_rasscript 

</pre>

<h2><a name="control">Control Parameters</a></h2>

<h3>window</h3>
A sliding window is used to generate backbone segments whose rotation
vectors are calculated for the clustering algorithm. The longer the
window the better local intrasegment rotations, which may have nothing
to do with the domain motion, are eliminated. A shorter window,
however, is preferable if one wants to accurately identify those
residues involved in the interdomain bending. In any case the length
of the window should be short compared to the minimum domain size. The
length of the window is specified by the number of residues. The
length of the window must be odd as the central residue must be
defined. Default=5

<h3>domain</h3>
This sets the minimum domain size in number of residues. It depends on
your feeling on how big a domain should be, to be called a domain. It
can be set as small as you like, but it wouldn't be logical to make it
smaller than the window length. Default=10% of total number of
residues

<h3>ratio</h3>
This value gives the minimum value for the ratio of interdomain
displacement to intradomain displacement for a domain pair. For a
precise definition of this value see the DynDom main reference. There
is no clear cutoff for this value, but the lower it is for a domain
pair, the less sensible it is to analyse their motion in terms of an
interdomain motion. The program calculates this value for every
prospective domain pair and outputs it to the screen. If you set the
minimum to a value much less than 1.0 you may end up analyzing
meaningless results. Default=1.0

<h2>Description of the Basic Methodology</h2>

<p>
<b>Determination of Dynamic Domains</b>
<p>
The program first determines the "dynamic domains." First, a whole
protein best fit of the two conformations is made. Then, rotation
vectors of residues or short main-chain segments are determined. A
clustering algorithm is then used to identify clusters of rotation
vectors. Groups of residues forming these clusters form possible
dynamic domains.

<p>
<b>Determination Hinge Axes</b>
<p>
Groups of residues are only accepted for the analysis of hinge axes if
they satisfy a criterion based on the ratio of the interdomain
displacement to intradomain displacement with another group of
residues with which there exists a physical connection. If this is the
case the two groups of residues form dynamic domains and their
interdomain motion is meaningful. The axes determined are in fact
interdomain screw axes. This is based on the theorem of Chasles which
states that the general displacement of a rigid body is a screw
motion. The location of the interdomain screw axis tells us something
about the kind of motion allowed by the interdomain connections. It is
possible for the interdomain screw axis to be located far away from
the interdomain connections if they are very flexible. Only if the
interdomain screw axis is located near to those residues involved in
the interdomain bending (defined below) can we think of the axis as a
hinge axis. In such a case we call the axis an, "effective hinge axis"
and the residues are said to be acting as "mechanical hinges."

<p>
<b>Determination of Residues Involved in Interdomain Bending</b>
<p>
If one domain is fixed in space with the other rotating, then one will
see a rotational transition in the connecting region between the two
domains. One can define the residues involved in the interdomain
bending to be those at the interdomain boundaries, as found by the
clustering algorithm, plus those neighbouring residues whose rotations
are outside the main distribution of the domain to which they belong.

<p>
<b>Closure and Twist Motion</b>
<p>
Axes can be classified into two extreme types: those parallel to the
line joining the centres of mass of a pair of domains, and those
perpendicular to this line. The former are called twist axes, the
latter, closure axes. Any axis can be decomposed into components
parallel or perpendicular to this line and a percentage measure of the
degree of closure motion can be defined from the square of the
projection on the closure axis.

<h2>How DynDom Works</h2>

<p>
DynDom uses the K-means clustering algorithm to find clusters of
rotation vectors. The number of clusters found is specified by the
user, but should be set high as DynDom automatically finds the largest
number of clusters for which one may reasonably regard the
conformational change in terms of domain motions.

<p>
DynDom uses the K-means clustering algorithm to find clusters of
rotation vectors.
<p>
A cluster in rotation space may not correspond to a
cluster in real space, but rather a fragmented region.
Such a fragmented region one would not normally call a domain.
DynDom splits up any clusters that do not correspond to heavy
atoms connected through a network of distances of
3.5 angstrom or less, into domains. In order for DynDom to analyse
domain pairs in terms of their interdomain movement two criteria
must be satisfied.  The first concerns the minimum domain size.  If a
domain comprises fewer residues than the minimum domain size set by
the user, then segments from this domain are
united with the larger domains they are embedded in.
If <i>all</i> the domains from <i>any single</i> cluster are
smaller than the minimum domain size, the program
stops, unless this the first cluster found (K=2).
<p>
For every domain larger than the minimum size, the program checks which are
connected directly through the backbone (not through another domain), and calculates the ratio
of interdomain displacement to intradomain displacement for every connected pair.
If this ratio is less than the user specified minimum (the second criterion) then
 this pair are not analysed.
The program finds the largest number of clusters for which
<i>all</i> connected domain pairs that satisfy both criteria.
It is these domain pairs that are analysed in terms of interdomain screw axes, etc.
If this is not possible it will analyse any domain pair for
interdomain screw axes, etc, provided that the two criteria are satisfied.
