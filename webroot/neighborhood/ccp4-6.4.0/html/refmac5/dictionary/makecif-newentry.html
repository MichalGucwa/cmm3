<h2><a name="coord_dict">How to make a dictionary entry from the coordinate file? </a></h2>
<p> Coordinate file formats recognised are pdb, small molecular cif and mmCIF.</p>

<p> If there is a pdb coordinate file then REFMAC can be used to create a dictionary entry. In this case following script should be used:</p>


<pre>
refmac XYZIN &ltnew_ligand.pdb&gt; XYZOUT &lt;new_ligand1.pdb&gt; \
LIB_IN &lt;my_lib_if_there_is_any.lib&lt; LIB_OUT &lt;my_new_lib.lib&gt; 
&lt;&lt; eor
#
#
MODE NEWEntry
MAKE EXIT Yes
#
END
eor
</pre>
<p> If ligand contained in the coordinate file is not in the list of <a href="list-of-ligands.html">the standard entries</a> then the program will create 
a description for it and add them to the user supplied entry 
lists specified by LIB_IN. Output file will be written to the file specified by 
LIB_OUT (default is new.lib) in the command line. If there is no user supplied 
entry list (i.e. LIB_IN has not been specified) then created file will contain 
new entry only. Then this file if desired could be merged with old entry lists 
using conventional editors (not reccommended). </p>

<p>It is recommended that new entry description to be checked prior to using 
in refinement. Especially atom types should be checked. If there are hydrogens
the program creates dictionary files usually correctly. If there is no 
hydrogens in many cases program creates dictionary entries correctly. If 
coordinates are not good then atom types may not be correct. In this case atom 
types in new entry list could be corrected and program should be rerun with 
minimum description.</p>

<p> If description of the ligand is not as desired by the user then he could 
use sketcher to correct the coordinates and the description for it.</p>

<p> After having new entries and checking them carefully then normal refmac 
could be run with new ligand supplied like:
<pre>
refmac ... LIB_IN &lt;my_new_ligands&gt; ... &lt;&lt; eor

Command lines to use refmac

eor
</pre>
Another way of making new entries from coordinates is using 
<a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~alexei/libcheck.html">libcheck</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="connect_dict">Dictioanary entries from the pdb style connectivity 
list</a></h2>
<p> One way of deriving dictionary entry is using pdb style connectivity list
as shown in Text 1. Extreme care should be taken when using pdb style 
connectivity list as it is formatted file and all atoms including hydrogens
must be present with all their connectivity. If at least one atom (for example
hydrogen) is absent
then whole geometry of the ligand may become incorrect as the program will
interpret bonds incorrectly. When connectivity list is ready <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~alexei/libcheck.html">libcheck</a> 
could be used to derive <a href="#minimum_dict">minimum description</a>:
<pre>
libcheck &lt;&lt; rol

_file_dic my_pdb_connectivity.dic
eol 
eol
</pre>
The the program libcheck will create minimum description as in Text 2 and it will
be written in new_mon_lib.cif. Then this file should be copied to another
file and checked carefully. After checking and editing technique described
in <a href="#minimum_dict">the next section</a> should be used to derive 
dictionary entry and coordinates to use by the graphics program</p>

<p> After editting minimum description to user's satisfaction it could be used 
to derive new entry list and coordinates using <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~alexei/libcheck.html">libcheck</a>.

<h2><a name="minimum_dict">Dictionary enrries from minimum description of the ligand</a></h2>
<p> When information  about connectivity is available i.e. which atom 
is bond to what and contents of ligand i.e. which element occupies which 
position then minimum description could be used to derive dictionary entry for
the ligand. It is good idea first to draw ligand on a piece of paper like:
<pre>


                       
          OH            
          |           
    HO    C2     O1-P1(O3)
      \   /\   /
       \ /  \ /
        C3   C1
        |    |
        |    |
        C4   C6
       : \  / :
      :   \/   :
     O4    C5    OH
     |     |
   P4(O3)  O5
           |
           P5(O3)

     Figure 1
</pre>
Where dotted lines show that atom is below the picture and dashed lines show
above the picture.</p>



<p>If this pictire is converted to the minimum description it will have the 
form as in <a href="Text1.html">Text 1</a></p>

<p>When making minimum description one should be careful with the chiral 
volumes present in the ligand.

<p>Then <a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~alexei/libcheck.html">libcheck</a> could be run like:</p>

<pre>
libcheck &lt;&lt; eol
N
_file_l &lt;minimum_description&gt;
_mon MON
eol
</pre>

<p> Where &lt;minimum_description&gt; is the file containing a minimim 
description and MON is the name of the ligand.</p>  

<p> After libcheck there will be complete dictionary description and coordinate
files in mmCIF and pdb format with all hydrogens present.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> In some cases atom names may not be as you wish them to be. 
Before running refmac or libcheck to create dictionary it is better to rename 
atoms to your or IUPAC or somebody's satisfaction.</p>
