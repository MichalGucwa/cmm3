<h1>DICTIONARY</h1>

<h2><a name="minimum_dict" id="minimum_dict"></a>Dictionary entries from minimum description of the ligand</h2>

<p>When information about connectivity is available (<em>i.e.</em> which atom
is bonded to what) and about the contents of the ligand (<em>i.e.</em> which element
occupies which position), then a minimum description can be used to derive a dictionary
entry for the ligand. It is a good idea first to draw the ligand on a piece of paper like:</p>
<blockquote><pre>


                       
          OH
          |
    HO    C2    O1-P1(O3)
      \   /\   /
       \ /  \ /
        C3   C1
        |    |
        |    |
        C4   C6
       : \  / :
      :   \/   :
     O4    C5   OH
     |     |
   P4(O3)  O5
           |
           P5(O3)

     Figure 1</pre></blockquote>
<p>where dotted lines show that the atom is below the plane of the paper/screen and dashed lines
above the plane of the paper/screen.</p>

<p>If this picture is converted to the minimum description, it will have the
form as in <a href="Text1.html">Text 1</a>.</p>

<p>When making a minimum description, one should be careful with the chiral
volumes present in the ligand. For a description of chiral volumes and their
relation of them to R- and S-forms, see
<a href="../theory/chiral.html">chiral volume description</a>.

<p>Then <a href="../../libcheck.html">LIBCHECK</a> could be run like:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
libcheck &lt;&lt; eol
N
_file_l &lt;minimum_description&gt;
_mon MON
eol
</pre></blockquote>
<p>where &lt;<tt>minimum_description</tt>&gt; is the file containing a minimum
description and <tt>MON</tt> is the name of the ligand.</p>

<p>After LIBCHECK there will be a complete dictionary description and coordinate
files in mmCIF and PDB format with all hydrogens present.</p>
