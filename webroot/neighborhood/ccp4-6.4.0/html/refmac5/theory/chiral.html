<h3><a name="why" id="why"></a>Why use chirality?</h3>

<p>There are two reasons for using chiral centres. Firstly they are used in
refinement. Secondly they are important when new coordinates are created from
the chemical description.<p>
<p>Use in the refinement and new coordinate creation are different although similar.
As restraints they are useful at low resolution and at the
early stages of refinement when coordinates are poor. If all four atoms
surrounding a chiral centre have been given, or at high resolution and at the end 
stages of the refinement, the use of chiral volume as a restraint may be abandoned.</p>
<p>In refmac it can be switched off using:
<pre>
CHIR 0.0
</pre>
Then REFMAC will print out information about chiral volumes but they will not be
used in restraints (<em>i.e.</em> chirality restraints will have weight 0).</p>

<td rowspan="2">Sometimes even if there is no chiral centre, some atoms may be used as
having chirality. For example in figure 1 carbons bound to NH<sub>2</sub> are not chiral
centres. But chirality can be used in this case to preserve conformation of the molecule
during refinement.</td>

<p>Another important use of chiral centres is for coordinate creation. In this case
proper chiral volumes and their signs should be used. They are important in deciding
which stereoisomer should be created.</p>

<h3><a name="definition" id="definition"></a>Definition of chiral centres</h3>

<table border="0"><a name="figure2" id="figure2"></a>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">The Origin of the word chiral is Greek <i>cheir</i>, which means 
'handedness'. If molecules cannot be superimposed on their mirror images, they are called 
chiral. It is like left and right hands. The mirror image of the right hand is the left 
hand, which cannot be superimposed on the right hand. For example in the figure 2 the left
and right images are not superimposable.</td>

<p>Chiral centres are usually (but not always) a property of chiral molecules. 
What decides if an atom is a chiral centre? If an atom has four bonds then use 
<a href="#sequence_rules">sequence rules</a>. If all four atoms attached to 
the considered atom have different priorities, it is a chiral centre. If at 
least two atoms have the same priority, this atom is not a chiral centre.
There are cases when a molecule has no chiral centres but still is chiral. For example
the molecule in the <a href="#figure1">figure 1</a> is chiral without chiral centres.</p>
<p>Chiral centres are a property of atoms with sp3 hybridisation. Potential
chiral centres should have a tetrahedral bonding environment.</p>
<p>Chiral centres are defined by four atoms:
<tt>atom1 atom2 atom3 atom4</tt></p>
<p>Here <tt>atom1</tt> is the chiral centre and <tt>atom2</tt>, <tt>atom3</tt>,
<tt>atom4</tt> are three of the four atoms bound to the centre. The sign of the chiral
volume depends on the arrangement of these atoms.</p>

<h4>Procedure to find the sign of a chiral centre</h4>

<table border="0"><a name="figure3" id="figure3"></a>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">
<ol>
<li>Put <tt>atom1</tt> and draw bonds from the centre (<tt>atom1</tt>) to
<tt>atom2</tt>, <tt>atom3</tt>, <tt>atom4</tt> as in figure 3. When the eye goes from
<tt>atom2</tt> to <tt>atom4</tt> it should travel clockwise.</li>
<li>Assuming that <tt>atom2</tt>, <tt>atom3</tt>, <tt>atom4</tt> are in the plane
of the picture, then if <tt>atom1</tt> is below the plane, the chiral volume sign
is plus, and otherwise it is minus.
If the numbering is based on the <a href="#sequence_rules">sequence rules</a>,
a positive chiral volume corresponds directly to R and negative to S
(see <a href="#relation">below</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that if <tt>atom1</tt> is below the plane of the picture, then the fourth atom
around this central atom is also below the plane of the picture.</p></td>

<p>There is a relationship between the sign of the chiral volume and right/left-handed coordinate 
systems. If chiral volume's sign is positive then vectors 2-1, 3-1, 4-1 form a right handed
coordinate system. Otherwise they form a left handed coordinate system.</p>

<h3><a name="sequence_rules" id="sequence_rules"></a>Sequence rules</h3>

<p>There are 3 major rules in finding the relative priority of the atoms attached 
to the chiral centres. These rules are also used in deciding geometric isomers,
<em>i.e.</em> <i>cis/trans</i> conformations.</p> 

<p>Rule 1:</p>
<p>Atoms attached to the centre with higher atomic number have highest priority.
If atoms have the same atomic number, a heavier isotope has higher priority.</p>
<p>Example: in <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a> Cl has higher priority than the other 3 atoms.</p>

<p>Rule 2:</p>
<p>If the relative priority of the attached atoms cannot be decided using
their weights, then atoms bound to them are compared. If these cannot define priorities, the next
atoms are compared. It is not the overall weight of the group attached to the central atom
which determines the priority; it is considered step-by-step, in levels outward from the central atom.
If at least one of the atoms in a group (<em>e.g.</em> <tt>atom2</tt> and its directly attached atoms)
is heavier than any in another group (<em>i.e.</em> <tt>atom3</tt> and <tt>atom4</tt> and their
directly attached atoms) then the first atom (<em>i.e.</em> <tt>atom2</tt>) has higher priority. If
the heaviest atoms in both groups are the same, their number is considered. Then the next heaviest
atoms are compared and so on. It should be repeated outwards from the centre until all atoms have
been considered <em>or the first point of difference has been encountered</em>. If atoms cannot be
distinguished at the end, they are equal and there is no chiral centre.</p>
<p>Example: in <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a> CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> has higher priority
than CH<sub>3</sub> since C is heavier than H.</p>

<p>Rule 3:</p>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">If one of bonds is double or triple, the atoms to which it is attached
are 'cloned', see figure 4. After that, the previous rules are applied again.</td>

<p>In the case of an aromatic structure like a benzene ring, only one of the Kekul&#233;
structures should be considered, see figure 5. Left and right images are two Kekul&#233; structures
of a benzene ring (middle image). In these cases only one of them should be considered. Then rule 3 is
applied and after that rules 1 and 2 are applied.</p>

<h3><a name="relation" id="relation"></a>Relation between chiral centres and R/S definitions</h3>

<p>To determine whether a chiral centre is R (Latin: <i>rectus</i>) or S (Latin:
<i>sinister</i>) first use the <a href="#sequence_rules">sequence rules</a> to assign priorities. Then
draw a picture so that the atom with lowest priority seems below the plane of the
picture. Then start counting from the highest priority to the lowest. If your eye goes
in a clockwise direction, the configuration is R, otherwise it is S. The molecule
shown on the left-hand side of <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a> is R and that on the right
is S.</p>
<p>If <a href="#sequence_rules">sequence rulings</a> have been used in determining the order of
the atoms in the chiral centre, <em>i.e.</em> highest priority is first, second is second priority
and third is third priority, then the configuration R has a chiral volume with plus sign
and S has a chiral volume with a minus sign. If the order of the atoms is different,
then adjustment should be made accordingly. It should be remembered that if two
atoms swap their places in the sequence, the sign changes.</p>
