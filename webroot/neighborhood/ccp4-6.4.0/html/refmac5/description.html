<h2><A NAME="description"></A>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>REFMAC now has two 'modes': REVIEW which only checks and updates the input model 
to establish that the geometric restraints can be properly  
set up, and the standard REFINE mode documented in <a href="keywords/index.html">keywords</a>.</p>

<h3>REFMAC in REVIEW mode</h3>

<ol>
<li>Checking the model coordinates and writing an extended output set of coordinates.
<p>This replaces and extends one of the roles of PROTIN.
The input model (or PDB file) will contain coordinates identified by a CHAIN identifier,
a RESIDUE (or more precisely, a monomer) identifier (<em>e.g.</em> ALA TYR HEM HOH) and an atom name
(<em>e.g.</em> CA or Fe+3). The output file will have the following extra information.</p>
</li>

<li><b>Refmac actions:</b> Finding disulphide bonds, and other covalent links.
<p>REFMAC now does a preliminary distance angles check on the input coordinates
and suggests likely di-sulphide bonds and other links. These are written to the
output PDB file in the standard PDB format:</p>

<p>The LINK record can be modified by the user to include the target distance.
In this format: the distance has format F10.5.</p>

</li>

<li><b>Refmac actions:</b> Finding cis-peptides.
<p>REFMAC now does a preliminary survey of cis-peptides and writes the
records to the output PDB file.</p>
<pre>
CISPEP   1 SER A   26    PRO A   27          0         0.00
CISPEP   1 HIS A  220    PRO A  221          0         0.00
</pre>
</li>

<li><b>Refmac actions:</b> Outputting the sequence and REMARK records.
<p>REFMAC does not output the SEQRES records to the XYZOUT file. All REMARK records
are stripped out; those relevant to refinement are replaced.</p>

<p><b>All this output needs to be carefully checked, and edited by the user.</b></p>
<p>If this is enough to describe the chemistry of the model completely,
the REFINE mode of refmac can be started without any other action.
However, if the molecule under study has a novel group REFMAC in REVIEW mode
will exit with a message requiring the user to provide a complete chemical description of this.</p>

<p>Obviously, before starting restrained refinement it is necessary that the chemical
properties of each monomer in the model (<em>i.e.</em> the identifier and charge for
each atom, the connectivity and bond types with target distances and
standard uncertainities, the angles, chiral centres, planar groups, target
torsion angles) are described. For the standard peptides,
sugars, and nucleotides plus some common ligands these are provided in
distributed library files in $CLIBD_MON/. For any other monomers the user
must provide their own library.</p>
</li>

<li><b>SKETCHER/LIBCHECK actions:</b> These are the tools used within CCP4
for creating a complete chemical description of a novel monomer. The user
should first sketch on paper a detailed picture of the expected ligand,
showing single and double bonds, hydrogens, chiral centres and planar groups,
and possibly atomic charges (for example see
<a href="dictionary/minimum-dict.html">Dictionary entry from minimum description</a>).
This can be entered into SKETCHER, either by actually adding atoms to the sketch,
or by reading in a PDB file with a similar ligand. This can be edited in SKETCHER,
and once the user is satisfied that there is a reasonable depiction of the ligand
on the screen, SKETCHER will generate a minimal description tabulating all the given
information. This minimal description is then
extended by LIBCHECK to create a complete monomer description written to
the file assigned to LIBOUT.</p>
</li>
 
</ol>

<h3>REFMAC in REFINEMENT mode</h3>

<p>The REFMAC program can carry out rigid body, <a href="usage/tls_usage.html">tls</a>, restrained or unrestrained
refinement against Xray data, or idealisation of a macromolecular structure.
It minimises the coordinate parameters to satisfy either a Maximum Likelihood
or Least Squares residual. There are options to use different minimization
methods. <em>(At the moment only CGMAT is active.)</em> REFMAC also produces an MTZ output
file containing weighted coefficients for SigmaA weighted mFo-DFcalc and
2mFo-DFcalc maps, where &quot;missing data&quot; have been restored.</p>

<p>[Program organisation and communication with it is illustrated in the
<a href="usage/examples.html">EXAMPLES</a> section.]</p>
