<H2> DESCRIPTION</H2>

The program analyses model anisotropic U values supplied on 
<a href="pdbformat.html#part1ani">ANISOU records</a> in the input PDB
file (XYZIN).  These may originate for example from a full anisotropic
refinement by <a href="refmac5.html">REFMAC</a> for atomic resolution data. 
Plots of average equivalent isotropic B values, anisotropy, and radial and 
tangential projections against residue are produced.
<p>
Using rigid groups defined in TLSIN, it can fit TLS values to the observed
U values. These are output in TLSOUT, and residual U values are output 
in XYZOUT. The so-called L2 norm is used as the residual for fitting
U's calculated from TLS tensors to the observed Us obtained from refinement.
<p>
The program can also analyse the input anisotropic U values in terms of
<a href="#references">Rosenfield's</a> rigid-body postulate. Output plots
give an indication of whether groups of atoms (as defined in TLSIN) have 
U values conforming to rigid-body-like displacements. A postscript plot
is also produced which may hint at possible rigid groups.
<p>
The plots against residue may be useful for visualising U values obtained
from the program <a href="tlsanl.html">TLSANL</a>. However, the rigid group
analysis is less useful, since in this case the U values will have been
obtained from a rigid group description in the first place.

<H2> INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES</H2>
<H3> XYZIN</H3>
<p>Input coordinates with anisotropic U values held in standard ANISOU records.
The elements of U are assumed to appear as integers representing 10000*Uij in
orthogonal coordinates, and in the order U11, U22, U23, U12, U13, U23.</p>
<p>The program will check for non-positive-definite anisotropic U values,
and report any found to the log file. Non-positive-definite means that
one of the eigenvalues is less than or equal to zero, which in turn
means that one of the radii of the thermal ellipsoid has vanished.</p>

<H3> TLSIN</H3>
Rigid group definitions for TLS groups. The format of the TLS file is as
given in the <a href="restrain.html">RESTRAIN</a> documentation, 
with the following addition. The RANGE
record can include the subkeyword FIT or APPLY. Atoms included in the FIT
range are used both for fitting the TLS values, and in calculating residual
U's for XYZOUT. Atoms in APPLY are used only for the latter. Thus, one may
want to use only main chain atoms for fitting TLS values, but then apply
these TLS values to all atoms in the molecule. Only TLS and RANGE records
are required, to define the chosen TLS groups.
<H3> XYZOUT </H3>
Output coordinates and residual anisotropic U values.
<H3> TLSOUT </H3>
Fitted TLS tensors for groups defined in TLSIN. This file can be input
to <a href="tlsanl.html">TLSANL</a> for further analysis. Note that
TLSOUT contains a REFMAC record to flag that the file contains tensor
elements in the order used in REFMAC, rather than the order used by RESTRAIN.

<h3>PSOUT</h3>
Postscript plot of "delta" values between all selected pairs of atoms.
Light shading implies low "delta" value, consistent with the atoms belonging
to the same quasi-rigid group. Dark shading means the atoms are unlikely to
belong to the same quasi-rigid group. See <a href="#key_rigidbody">RIGIDBODY</a>
keyword.
<p>

<H2> KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>

<h3><a name="key_title">TITLE &lt;title&gt;</h3>
Title for the job.

<h3><a name="key_fittls">FITTLS [OFF]</h3>
Fit TLS parameters to individual anisotropic U values (default).
If OFF specified then don't. If TLS parameters are to be fitted, then
the input file TLSIN should be given.

<H3><a name="key_tlscycles">TLSCYCLES &lt;tlsc&gt;</H3>
Number of cycles of TLS fitting. With current residual, should converge
in first cycle! Default is 2 cycles.

<h3><a name="key_rigidbody">RIGIDBODY [OFF]</h3>
Assess <a href="#references">Rosenfield's</a> rigid-body postulate (default). 
If OFF specified then don't. The rigid-body postulate states that for two atoms
belonging to the same rigid-body (not necessarily bonded), the projections of 
the anisotropic displacement parameters along the interatomic vector should be
equal. In practice, we expect the difference between the projections to
be smaller for atoms belonging to the same quasi-rigid body, and larger for
atoms belonging to different quasi-rigid bodies.
<p>
For all pairs of atoms, the absolute difference in the projection as a 
fraction of the mean projection (the
"delta" value) is calculated, and all such differences are binned (see 
the keyword <a href="#key_dubins">DUBINS</a>). These "delta" values are
displayed graphically in a postscript plot (file PSOUT, default anisoanl.ps).
Light shading implies low "delta" value, consistent with the atoms belonging
to the same quasi-rigid group. Dark shading means the atoms are unlikely to
belong to the same quasi-rigid group. Atom selection can be done with
the file TLSIN - only atoms specified in this file are used in the calculation.
For example, clearer results may be obtained if only CA atoms are used.
See Tom Schneider's <a href="#references">article</a> for an example of
this kind of plot.
<p>
The distribution of "delta" values is included in the log output (see
keywords <a href="#key_dubins">DUBINS</a> and <a href="#key_durange">DURANGE</a>).
Possible quasi-rigid bodies should be defined using the TLSIN file
(see <A href="#example2">example</A> below). The distribution is plotted
for all pairs of atoms within each quasi-rigid body, and a final plot
gives the distribution for pairs of atoms from different groups.
If the choice of rigid bodies is good, the differences
should be significantly smaller within groups than between them. A subset of atoms
can be chosen using the atom selection field in TLSIN (e.g. "CA" may be useful
for large rigid groups).

<h3><a name="key_dubins">DUBINS &lt;dist_bins&gt; &lt;ps_bins&gt;</h3>
Specify the number of bins for the <a href="#key_rigidbody">RIGIDBODY</a>
plots. &lt;dist_bins&gt; refers to the distribution plot, and &lt;ps_bins&gt;
to the postscript plot. Defaults are 30 and 10 (maximum is 100).

<h3><a name="key_durange">DURANGE &lt;range&gt;</h3>
Specify the range of values covered by the <a href="#key_rigidbody">RIGIDBODY</a>
plot. Default is 0.3. The "delta" values are defined as the absolute difference 
in the projection as a fraction of the mean projection, so the maximum
range is 2.0

<h3><a name="key_plot">PLOT [OFF]</h3>
Produce plots of equivalent isotropic U values, anisotropy, and projections
of U (default).  If OFF specified then don't. See below for a
description of the plots produced.

<h3><a name="key_mainchain">MAINCHAIN</h3>
Use main chain atoms only in producing plots. Default is to use
all atoms.

<h3><a name="key_verbose">VERBOSE</h3>
Produces extra output.

<H3><a name="key_end">END</H3>
Terminate input.
<p>

<H2> PROGRAM OUTPUT</H2>

<h3>FITTLS option</h3>

For each cycle of fitting, the residual, the R value and the Goodness of Fit
are printed. The R value is sqrt(sum deltaU**2 / sum Uobs**2), and the
Goodness of Fit is 1000 * sqrt(sum deltaU**2 / (num observables - num parameters))
(the factor of 1000 is one over a typical sigmaU). These values are given
for (i) atoms used in fitting (FIT), (ii) atoms included in TLS
group but not used for fitting (APPLY).

<h3>PLOT option</h3>

The PLOT option displays graphs of the following quantities:
<dl>
<dt>Uiso
<dd>The equivalent isotropic U factor calculated as 1/3*trace(U).
<dt>R2FROMORIG
<dd>The square of the distance from the local origin. If the FITTLS 
option is being used, then the local origin is taken to
be the origin of the TLS group to which the atom belongs. Otherwise,
the local origin is taken to be the centroid of the chain
to which the atom belongs (i.e. the mean atomic coordinates of that
chain). The values of R2FROMORIG are divided by a scaling factor
(currently 3000) for convenience of plotting.
<dt>Anisotropy
<dd>This is defined as the ratio of the smallest to the largest 
eigenvalue of U.
<dt>PROLMEAN
<dd>This factor is defined as the ratio of the middle to the largest 
eigenvalue of U. If the thermal ellipsoid corresponding to U is
oblate (disc-like), then this factor will be close to 1. If however it is
prolate (cigar-like), then this factor will be close to the value
of the anisotropy
<dt>URADMEAN
<dd>The projection of U onto a radial vector from the local origin
(see above) to the atomic position.
<dt>UTANGMEAN
<dd>The average value of U projected on to a plane perpendicular
to the radial vector.
<dt>UISOMEAN2, ANISOMEAN2, PROLMEAN2
<dd>If TLS groups have been fitted, then the values of Uiso, A
and PROLMEAN as derived from the fitted TLS parameters are also
given.
<dt>Radial distribution of Urad and Utang
<dd>In a separate graph, Urad and Utang are plotted against R**2.
For rigid body motion, Urad should be constant, and Utang linear in R**2.
</dl>
All quantities are averaged over the atoms in each residue, unless
the <a href="#key_mainchain">MAINCHAIN</a> is given, in which case
the average is over main chain atoms only.

</pre>
The two rigid groups are two PHE side chains. This example gives a clear
indication of the two phenyl groups acting as rigid-bodies. Similar results
can be obtained for domain-size quasi-rigid bodies, though never as
clear-cut. 
<p>
In this case, the postscript plot is unhelpful - it is more helpful
for looking at larger groups of atoms.
