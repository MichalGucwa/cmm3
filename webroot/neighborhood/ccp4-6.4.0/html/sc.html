<b>sc </b>
- Determine Sc shape complementarity of two interacting molecular surfaces
<H2> SYNOPSIS </H2>
<b>sc</b> <b>XYZIN</b> <i>foo.pdb</i> [ <b>SCRADII</b> <i>radii.lib</i> ]
[ <b>SURFIN1</b> <i>foo1_in.srf</i> <b>SURFIN2</b> <i>foo2_in.srf</i>

 [<a href="#keywords">Keyworded input</a>]
<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>

<P>The shape correlation statistic Sc (<a href="#reference1">Lawrence and
Colman, 1993</a>) can be used to quantify the
shape complementarity of protein/protein interfaces and give an idea
of the &quot;goodness of fit&quot; between two protein surfaces. The program SC
will calculate values of Sc and related statistics for the interface
region between two molecules in a Brookhaven coordinate file.

<P>SC also allows the normal products to be merged into GRASP surface
files for display in <A HREF="http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/grasp/">GRASP</A> (<a href="#reference4">Nicholls, 1993</a>).

<H2> <a name="keywords"></a>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>

<P>The input comprises three sections:

<H3><A NAME="keywords_molecule_definition"></A>Section 1: Molecule definition (compulsory)</H3>

<P>The molecule definition commands are used to select which atoms in the
input file are to make up the two individual molecules for the Sc calculation.
Entries for this section appear twice, once for each molecule (see
<a href="#examples">EXAMPLES</a>):

different values for <A HREF="#probe_radius">PROBE_RADIUS</A>, <A HREF="#trim">TRIM</A> and <A HREF="#weight">WEIGHT</A> if you intend to compare
your values of Sc with the results of other calculations, or with values
found in the literature.

<H2>KEYWORDS</H2>

<a name="molecule"></a><H3>MOLECULE &lt;n&gt;</H3>
This selects which molecule to put the subsequent selection
in; &lt;n&gt; is either 1 or 2. This keyword is followed by a combination
of <A HREF="#chain">CHAIN</A>, <A HREF="#zone">ZONE</A>, <A HREF="#at_excl">AT_EXCL</A> and/or <A HREF="#at_incl">AT_INCL</A> keywords, which then select the atoms
which will be included as the molecule. Selection via these subsequent
keywords is logically sequential.

<a name="chain"></a><H3>CHAIN &lt;chn&gt;</H3>
Include a particular chain. All atoms in chain &lt;chn&gt will be
included in the selected molecule.

<a name="zone"></a><H3>ZONE [ &lt;chn1&gt; ] &lt;res1&gt; [ &lt;chn2&gt; ] &lt;res2&gt;</H3>
Include a zone of residues. All atoms in and between the named residues
will be included in the selected molecule. The chain names &lt;chn1&gt; and
&lt;chn2&gt; should be omitted if the chain identifier field is blank within
the coordinate file. &lt;res1&gt; and &lt;res1&gt; define the residue sequence numbers
(not type) that delimit the selected zone.

<a name="at_excl"></a><H3>AT_EXCL [ &lt;chn&gt; ] &lt;res&gt; &lt;atm&gt;</H3>
Exclude a particular atom. The atom identified by chain &lt;chn&gt;,
residue sequence number &lt;res&gt; and atom name &lt;atm&gt will be excluded from
the selected molecule. The chain name &lt;chn&gt; should be omitted if
the chain identifier field is blank within the coordinate file.

<a name="at_incl"></a><H3>AT_INCL [ &lt;chn&gt; ] &lt;res&gt; &lt;atm&gt;</H3>
Include a particular atom. The atom identified by chain &lt;chn&gt;,
residue sequence number &lt;res&gt; and atom name &lt;atm&gt will be included from
the selected molecule. The chain name &lt;chn&gt; should be omitted if
the chain identifier field is blank within the coordinate file.

<a name="probe_radius"></a><H3>PROBE_RADIUS &lt;rad&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: 1.7 &#197;]

<p>Sets the radius of the probe sphere which is used to define the
solvent excluded surface.

<p><b>Note:</b>You should avoid changing the probe radius if you
intend to cross-compare the results of the Sc calculation with values obtained
elsewhere, as the comparison will be invalid if different probe radii are
used.

<a name="dot_density"></a><H3>DOT_DENSITY &lt;dots&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: 15 dots/&#197;<sup>2</sup>]

<p>The density of the dots used to calculate the molecular
surface - higher values (more dots per unit area) give higher
precision but also take longer to run.

<a name="trim"></a><H3>TRIM &lt;trim&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: 1.5 &#197;]

<p>Sets the distance used to generate the peripheral band.

<p>The peripheral band consists of those surface points which are
part of the buried portion of the molecular surface but which lie
within a distance &lt;trim&gt; of the non-buried (<EM>i.e.</EM> solvent
accessible) surface. Points in the peripheral band are omitted
from the calculations.

<p><b>Note:</b> You should avoid changing the width of the peripheral band
if you intend to cross-compare the results of the Sc calculation with
values obtained elsewhere, as the value of Sc depends on the width of
the excluded band.

<a name="interface"></a><H3>INTERFACE &lt;dist&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: 8 &#197;]

<p>Distance determining which atoms are used in the calculations.
See <a href="#program_function">PROGRAM FUNCTION</a> for details about
this parameter before changing it.

<a name="weight"></a><H3>WEIGHT &lt;w&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: 0.5 &#197;<sup>-2</sup>]

<p>This sets the value of the weighting factor used in the calculation
of the surface complementarity function S(A-&gt;B).
(See <a href="#printer_output">PRINTER OUTPUT</a> for the definition of
S(A-&gt;B).)

<p><b>Note:</b> You should avoid changing the weighting factor if you
intend to cross-compare the results of the Sc calculation with values
obtained elsewhere, as the value of Sc depends on the weighting used.

<a name="grasp_match"></a><H3>GRASP_MATCH &lt;tol&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: 1.5 &#197;]

<p>The tolerance for equivalencing GRASP and SC surface points. The strategy
employed by the program is to assign to each GRASP surface vertex the
weighted normal dot product associated with the nearest Connolly surface
point to that vertex. If no point employed within the Sc calculation is found
within a distance &lt;tol&gt; of the vertex then the vertex is deemed to
be part of the non-interacting surface. The value of &lt;tol&gt; will
depend on the dot density and resolution of the respective surfaces. The
non-interacting surfaces are assigned a general property 1 value assigned
by the <a href="#grasp_background">GRASP_BACKGROUND</a> keyword (below).

<a name="grasp_background"></a><H3>GRASP_BACKGROUND &lt;val&gt;</H3>

<p>[Default: -2.0]

<p>General Property 1 value for vertices that lie more than
<a href="#grasp_match">GRASP_MATCH</a> from any Connolly point within the
interacting surfaces. The aim here is simply to set up a distinctly
different value that can hence be displayed in a separate colour within
GRASP.

<H3>Input files</H3>

<dl>
  <dt>XYZIN <dd>[Compulsory]<br>
                input pdb file containing the coordinates of the
                molecules for which the shape complementarity
                will be assessed.
                Note that multiple conformations are not permitted
                for atoms at the interface of the molecules. There are
                also appear to be problems with H atoms in XYZIN, see
                <a href="#know_problems">KNOWN PROBLEMS</a> below.
  <dt>SCRADII <dd>[Optional]<br>
                reference file containing the radii which will
                be assigned for atoms in XYZIN. This defaults
                to $CLIBD/sc_radii.lib but can be reassigned on the
                command line, for example if you have a modified
                reference file containing extra Van der Waals radii.
                You may have to specify the path explicitly to stop
                the program looking in $CLIBD for your file.<br>
                <b>Note:</b> It is recommended that you do not alter the
                existing entries if you intend to cross-compare the
                results of the Sc calculation with values obtained
                elsewhere, as the comparison will be invalid if
                different atomic radii are used.
  <dt>SURFIN1, SURFIN2 <dd>[Optional]<br>
                Two GRASP surface files, one for each molecule. These
                surfaces will have the weighted normal dot product
                assigned to each vertex in the interface.<br>
                See also <a href="#notes_on_grasp_files">NOTES ON GRASP FILES</a>.

<H3>Output files</H3>

<dl>
  <dt>SURFOUT1, SURFOUT2 <dd>[Only required if SURFIN1, SURFIN2 are specified]<br>
                 Output files for the GRASP surfaces, appended with the
                 weighted normal dot product as General Property1. These can
                 be re-read into GRASP for display.
</dl>


<H2><a name="printer_output"></a>PRINTER OUTPUT</H2>

<P>The program output includes the following loggraph tables for each of
the molecules.

<ol>

<li><b>Histograms of the distance functions between surfaces, D(1-&gt;2) and D(2-&gt;1)</b>

<p>D(A-&gt;B) is defined as

<p><center>D(A-&gt;B)(x<sub>A</sub>) = |x<sub>A</sub> - x'<sub>A</sub>|<sup>2</sup></center>
<p>where x<sub>A</sub> is a point on the interface (<EM>i.e.</EM> buried) surface of molecule
A and x'<sub>A</sub> is the nearest surface point to x<sub>A</sub> on
molecule B. (It is noted that differences in shape
complementarity are less well discerned by these simple distance metrics.
See <a href="#reference1">Lawrence and Colman, 1993</a>.)</p>

<li><b>Histograms of the surface complementarity functions, S(1-&gt;2) and S(2-&gt;1)</b>

<p>S(A-&gt;>B) (also referred to as the weighted normal dot product) is defined as

<p><center>S(A-&gt;B)(x<sub>A</sub>) = (n<sub>A</sub>.n'<sub>A</sub>) exp [-w(|x<sub>A</sub> - x'<sub>A</sub>|)<sup>2</sup>]</center>

<p>where x<sub>A</sub>, x'<sub>A</sub> have the same meanings as above,
n<sub>A</sub>,n'<sub>A</sub> are the normals to the surfaces at those points,
and w is a weighting factor.</p>

</ol>

<p>The shape correlation Sc is then defined as

<p><center>Sc = [ { S(A-&gt;B) } + { S(B-&gt;A) } ]/2</center>

<p>where the braces denote the median of the S(A-&gt;B), S(B-&gt;A) distributions.
(See <a href="#reference1">Lawrence and Colman, 1993</a> for more detailed
descriptions of these functions.)

<p>Interfaces with Sc = 1 will mesh precisely, interfaces with Sc
approximately zero will effectively be uncorrelated in their topography.

<p>Note that Sc may become rather meaningless when the buried area becomes
small, and hence it may not be a good measure for small crystal contacts. This
is simply because as the overall buried area becomes smaller and/or more
convoluted or disjointed in shape, the percentage removed as part of the
peripheral band increases substantially.

<H2><a name="program_function"></a>PROGRAM FUNCTION</H2>

<P>This program computes Sc between two molecules in a
numerical fashion. The algorithm is fully detailed in <a href="#reference1">Lawrence
and Colman, 1993</a>.
Briefly: the molecular surfaces are represented as a series
of discrete points (<a href="#reference2">Connolly, 1983</a>) of sufficiently
high surface sampling density (set by the <a href="#dot_density">DOT_DENSITY</a>
keyword) and S(1-&gt;2) and S(2-&gt;1) are then evaluated at these points.

<p>The interface surfaces are defined as being the portion of the molecular
surface of molecule 1 which is buried from solvent by its interaction with
molecule 2 (and vice versa). The molecular surface itself is defined
(<a href="#reference3">Richards, 1977</a>) as the union of contact and
re-entrant portions demarcated by a probe sphere of a given radius (set by
the <a href="#probe_radius">PROBE_RADIUS</a> keyword).

<p>Only atoms within the <a href="#interface">INTERFACE</a> distance of any
&quot;buried&quot; atoms (defined in the Connolly sense) are selected for initial
surface computation. This parameter does not enter formally into the
evaluation of Sc, its purpose is simply to speed up the computation by
excluding from consideration atoms remote from the interface. The program
in reality computes not the entire surface for the individual molecules,
but rather only for the subset of atoms within the
<a href="#interface">INTERFACE</a> distance from the other molecule. A
portion of this surface is non-physical, as it is buried with the core of
the individual molecule, however its presence does not affect the
computation of Sc as it is remote from the interaction. If there is any
doubt about the validity of this approach for a particular molecule, the
program should be rerun with a larger value for this parameter to ensure
that the computation is stable. Subsequently, a periphery band of
buried points are removed if they lie within a distance <a href="#trim">TRIM</a>
of any solvent accessible surface points.

<p>Cross-comparison of Sc numbers between proteins (<EM>i.e.</EM> characterisation of
surfaces as more or less complementary than other types of surface) is the
main interest in SC. This is only valid if the same values of the critical
parameters (probe radius, width of the peripheral band, atomic radii, weighting
factor) are used in both computations. To this end it is recommended that
the default values for the <a href="#probe_radius">PROBE_RADIUS</a>,
<a href="#trim">TRIM</a> width and the atomic radii set in the sc_radii.lib
file should be used, so that the results will be comparable with other
literature values.

<p>The program includes a modified version of Michael Connolly's subroutine
&quot;mds&quot; for calculating molecular surfaces; the original code
can be obtained from his website at
<a href="http://www.biohedron.com">http://www.biohedron.com</a>.
The version contained in SC is provided here with the consent of Michael Connolly.
The modifications include a minor bug fix, and use of the CCP4 library routines for
exiting on fatal errors (``CCPERR'') and for calculating vector products (``CROSS'').

<H2><A NAME="interaction_with_grasp"></A>INTERACTION WITH GRASP</H2>

<p>Sc itself cannot be computed satisfactorily within GRASP, as GRASP uses a
rather different approach to surface definition. However qualitative display of
the weighted normal products S(A-&gt;B) is possible - this is achieved by a simple
mapping of this value from the one surface to the other.

<OL>
<LI>Within GRASP compute a molecular surface for each of the
interacting molecules.</LI>

<LI>Write these surfaces out within GRASP.</LI>

<LI>Read these surfaces into SC and perform the Sc computation.
The surfaces will automatically be written out with the S(A-&gt;B) values
assigned to each surface.</LI>

<LI>Read the modified surfaces back into GRASP.</LI>

<LI>Colour the modified surfaces according to General Property
1. An appropriate colour ramp will need to be set up within GRASP to achieve
the desired effect. It will probably also be necessary to &quot;open&quot; the interface
up via rotating one of the surfaces, otherwise you won't see anything.</LI>
</OL>

<p>There are however some limits to SC's interaction with GRASP. See the
<a href="#notes_on_grasp_files">NOTES ON GRASP FILES</a> below.

<H2><A NAME="notes_on_grasp_files"></A>NOTES ON GRASP FILES</H2>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, GRASP is only available for Silicon Graphics
machines, and since the surface files it produces contain unformatted data
these files are not generally portable to other systems, <EM>e.g.</EM> Digital Alphas.

<p>SC will make a check on the compatibility of input surface files before
trying to read them in. In cases where it detects a problem, the files will
not be read in, no merging will be performed, and no output surface files will
be generated. In these cases, if GRASP output is required it will be necessary
to run SC on another machine which has compatible conventions for reading and
writing unformatted data.

<p>There have been some reports of bugs in GRASP 1.3.6 which have
caused problems with the GRASP output from SC. Please let us know if you
experience problems which might be due to such bugs.

<H2><A NAME="format_of_radii_file"></A>FORMAT OF THE RADII FILE</H2>

<P>It will be necessary to edit the radii file used by the program, if your
input file contains atoms which are not in the file already. It is not
recommended that you change the values of radii already in the file, as
this will compromise comparison of your calculated Sc values with
values used in the literature.

<P>Each entry in the file is a single line with three fields separated by
spaces, of the format:

<p><pre>Residue_name    Atom_name      Radius</pre>

<P>Either of the name fields can contain one or more wildcards (<EM>i.e.</EM> the
asterisk character '*') to match to multiple residues or atoms, <EM>e.g.</EM> O* will match
to O1, O2 etc. Unidentified residue/atom combinations will cause the program to
stop.

<p>The default radii file is sc_radii.lib in $CLIBD; to use a modified radii
file in a different directory, assign the filename and path via the SCRADII
logical name.

<H2><a name="know_problems">KNOWN PROBLEMS</H2>

<p>It is essential to remove ALL multiple conformations from the input PDB
file (XYZIN). If multiple conformations are present in the file then the
program may terminate with an message <tt>ERROR IN CHAIN CARD</tt> (from the
CCP4 libraries) - in which case it is recommended that you check that there
are no remaining multiple confirmations.</p>

<p>There also appear to be problems with H atoms in XYZIN. The program may stop with
error message "SC:  imaginary contain". Stripping H atoms from XYZIN seems to cure it.
It is not known how general this problem is, nor why it occurs.</p>

<p>If these problems persist, then please report it to CCP4.</p>
