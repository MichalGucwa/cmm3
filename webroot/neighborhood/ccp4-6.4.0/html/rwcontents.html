<H1> RWCONTENTS (CCP4: Supported Program)</H1>
<H2> NAME</H2>
<b>rwcontents </b>
- Count atoms by type, and other analyses

<H2> SYNOPSIS </H2>
<b>rwcontents xyzin </b>
<i>foo_in.xyz</i>
<BR>
[<A HREF="#keywords">Keyworded input</A>] </P>

<H2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></H2>

The program reads and analyses a PDB file. Information given includes
numbers of atoms by type, theoretical number of hydrogens, molecular weights,
Matthews Coefficient the sum of the atomic formfactors, F000, and the sum of
the square of the atomic formfactors, ie I000.
<p>
If the NHOH keyword is specified, the number of water molecules expected to be 
determined by PX at the given resolution and temperature is reported, as 
estimated by the statistical analysis of Carugo &amp; Bordo, Acta Cryst D, 
55, 479 (1999). This estimation is based on an analysis of structures deposited
at the Protein Data Bank. Only models having less that 3% heteroatom content
other than water were considered in this analysis. The predicted number
of crystallographic waters is meant only as a guide, and is not a substitute
for correct evaluation of electron density maps.

<H2><A NAME="keywords"></A>KEYWORDED INPUT</H2>

<H3><a name="nhoh"></a> NHOH &lt;reso&gt; [ ROOM | LOWT ] </H3>
Evaluate the number of water molecules expected to be determined by PX, as 
estimated by the statistical analysis of Carugo &amp; Bordo. This is determined
by the resolution &lt;reso&gt; which must be given. The subkeyword 
ROOM or LOWT specifies whether the expression for room temperature
or low temperature results is used (default ROOM).
