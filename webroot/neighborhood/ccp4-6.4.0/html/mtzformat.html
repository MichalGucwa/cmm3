<h2><a name="introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The MTZ file format is used for the storage of reflection data. The file
contains the data and a header of metadata. The former is held as a table 
with rows representing reflections and columns representing different quantities 
for each reflection. The latter aims to make the file self-contained by including
all necessary information, such as symmetry operations, cell dimensions, etc.
The MTZ file is a flat-file representation of a particular data model. We
first describe the data model, and then the particular implementation used.</p>

<H2><a name="datamodel">DATA MODEL</H2>

The MTZ file can contain an arbitrary number of columns of data provided they
belong to the same spacegroup (in principle, they need only belong to the
same Laue group, but this is not implemented). With only this restriction,
we consider arranging the columns of data in the following hierarchical manner: 
<pre>

    File -> Crystal -> Dataset -> Datalist -> Column 

</pre>
A `Crystal' is essentially a single crystal form: usually there will
be one crystal per derivative, unless a single derivative can
crystalise in several cells (e.g. RT and frozen). A `Dataset' is a set
of observations on a particular crystal. If data is collected at several
wavelengths, each of these becomes a separate dataset. A `Datalist' is
a grouping of associated columns. Thus a single list will hold both F
and SigF. Another list holds all four Hendrickson Lattman coefficients.
Each data list is linked to one of the datasets and each dataset is
linked to one of the crystals. There may be several data lists per
dataset and several datasets per crystal.
<p>
The Datalist level is not yet implemented in the MTZ format, but the
remainder of the above hierarchy is recorded in the MTZ file header.
The header lists the columns of data held in the file, and identifies which 
dataset they belong to, and in turn which crystal that dataset belongs to.
The crystals, datasets and columns are each identified by a label. The
labels for the datasets and columns need not be unique, provided the
full identification "crystal name/dataset name/column label" is unique.
<p>
Each crystal is further identified as belonging to a project, labelled
by a "project name". The project name is currently used in 
<a href="harvesting.html">Data Harvesting</a> where it corresponds to
a particular structure determination (and is equivalent to the mmCIF data 
item _entry.id). In the current implementation of MTZ files, the project
is simply an attribute of a crystal and is not an integral part of the data
structure.
<p>
The total number of datasets represented in a file is given by the keyword
NDIF in the main file header (see <a href="#fileformat">below</a>), 
and a list of the project, crystal and dataset names
associated with each dataset is given by the PROJECT, CRYSTAL and DATASET keywords
also in the main file header. Each dataset is identified internally by an
integer "dataset ID". For a merged single-record-per-reflection MTZ
file, each column has as one of its attributes (included in the COL keyword) 
a "dataset ID", which acts as a pointer to the main list of datasets. For
unmerged multi-record MTZ files, a column may be associated with several
datasets (corresponding to different batches) and the "dataset ID" is not used.
Instead, each batch header contains a "dataset ID", which points to the dataset
associated with that batch.
<p>
The main file header also contains properties of each dataset. Each crystal
can have its own cell dimensions identified by the keyword DCELL, e.g. native
and derivative crystals may well have significantly different cells. All
datasets belonging to a particular crystal should have the same cell dimensions. 
The information held in DCELL records is distinct from the general cell held in
the CELL record; the use of DCELL is now preferred. A wavelength can also
be attributed to each dataset via the keyword DWAVEL. Other dataset information
may be added in the future. The records DCELL and DWAVEL are optional; the
header reading routines assume that if they are present, then they will
occur immediately after the relevant PROJECT, CRYSTAL and DATASET keywords.
<p>
The dataset information can be viewed via the program <a href="mtzdump.html">
MTZDUMP</a>:

 * Base dataset:

        0 HKL_base
          HKL_base
          HKL_base

 * Number of Datasets = 1

 * Dataset ID, project/crystal/dataset names, cell dimensions, wavelength:

        1 HEWL
          wildtype
          native
             79.0026   79.0026   36.8933   90.0000   90.0000   90.0000
             1.54180

</pre>

<h3>Dataset naming conventions</h3>

The project, crystal and dataset names should obey the following rules:
<ol>
<li>Each name should be a single word containing alphanumeric characters
and underscores. However, do not choose a purely numeric name as
this will confuse some programs (XNAME="x13" is OK whereas XNAME="13" is not).
<li>Each name can be up to 64 characters long (the limit is imposed by the
format of the MTZ file header).
<li>Names are case sensitive.
</ol>

<h3>The base dataset</h3>

From CCP4 5.0, there should always be a base dataset, called HKL_base and with 
dataset ID of zero. This dataset will be added automatically by the library, if it 
doesn't already exist. The columns H, K and L are forced to belong to the Base dataset. 
Other columns will be assigned to the Base dataset if they are not assigned explicitly
to another dataset.

<h3>More on cell dimensions</h3>

Cell dimensions are stored in 3 places:
<dl>
<dt>CELL record in main header
<dd>The use of these cell dimensions is now deprecated.
<dt>DCELL record in main header
<dd>There is one DCELL record for each dataset. However, the CMTZ library
assumes that the cell dimensions are a property of the crystal, so that DCELL
will be identical for each dataset in the same crystal. This is a simplification.
Different datasets will in general provide different estimates of the crystal
cell dimensions.
<dt>Batch headers
<dd>In an unmerged MTZ file, each batch header records the cell dimensions
for that batch. Each batch belongs to a dataset (see "Associated dataset ID"
in the batch header) with a separate record of the cell dimensions, see above.
</dl>

<h3>Compatibility between MTZ files from different CCP4 releases</h3>

A brief history:
<dl>
<dt>CCP4 3.5
<dd>Added Project and Dataset names for use in data harvesting.
<dt>CCP4 4.1
<dd>Added dataset cell and wavelength information.
<dt>CCP4 4.2
<dd>Library will pass Crystal header line through, but no additional
functionality.
<dt>CCP4 5.0
<dd>Full support for Crystal line, and addition of HKL_base dataset.
</dl>
Later versions of CCP4 should read files produced in earlier versions.
Earlier versions of CCP4 should read files produced in later versions,
but may give out warnings of unrecognised header records. Although
some information will be lost, the older programs should continue to
run.

<H2><a name="fileformat"></a>THE MTZ FILE FORMAT</H2>
General description
<P> 
The MTZ reflection file format uses fixed length logical 'records'
written in a byte stream with, in general, 
four bytes for each data item (REAL*4), with a minimum of 3 columns and
currently a maximum of 200 columns of data per record, although these
limits could easily be increased.  Additional information (title,
cell dimensions, column labels, symmetry information, resolution range,
history information and, if necessary, batch titles and orientation
data) is contained in labelled header records.  The columns of the 
reflection data records are identified by alphanumeric labels held
as part of the file header information.  The user relates the item names
used by the program to the required data items, as identified by the labels, 
by means of assignment statements in the program control data.
<P> 
Record Formats
<P> 
The file contains basically two classes of records - header records and
reflection data records. A standard reflection data file contains the 
following items, in the order given, not necessarily all items have
to be present:
<ul>
<li>
The first 4 bytes should be "MTZ " (if the first 3 characters are
not "MTZ" then the library will complain that the file is not an MTZ file).
This is followed by an integer indicating the location of the header
records (which occur at the end after the reflections records). The integer
occupies sizeof(int) bytes (typically 4).
<li>
Next is the "machine stamp" held as 4 characters. This encodes the number 
formats of the of the architecture the file was written on. 
(In fact, the machine stamp is positioned 2 words from the start, 
where a word is sizeof(float), i.e. typically 8 bytes in. The first 4 half-bytes
represent the real, complex, integer and character formats, and the last
two bytes are currently unused.)
<li>
Reflection data starting at byte 21:
<br>
Columns of data held as REAL*4
<li>
A beginning of header record
<li>
A set of keyworded records containing

requested program label is of the correct type. For a list of all column types
see section <a href="#coltypes">COLUMN TYPES</a>.
<P> 
Normally the Miller indices will be held in the first
three columns though, within the definition of the format, there is no
restriction on the use of the columns of the reflection data records. However,
the subroutines which output the MTZ header information in a formatted way (e.g.
Subroutine LHPRT) presume that the first 3 columns of a standard MTZ file are
the Miller Indices, and the first 5 columns of a multi-record MTZ file are
H,K,L,M/ISYM and Batch number.

<H2><a name="storage"> STORAGE OF DATA ITEMS</H2>
This section describes the way in which some standard data items are stored in
an MTZ file.
<dl>
<dt> Item<dd>
Storage
<dt> h,k,l<dd>
The Miller indices are held as REAL*4
<dt> Structure Factors<dd>
The structure factor magnitude is held as a REAL*4
<dt> Phases<dd>
Phases are held as REAL*4 values in degrees.
<dt> S<dd>
There is no need for an S column in MTZ files - values of (4 sin**2
theta / lambda**2) are calculated and returned, for each reflection,
by the calls to LRREFF and LRREFL, and the max and min values are
stored in the header of the MTZ file as REAL*4 (cf old-LCF as 10000*S
as INTEGER*2).
<dt> Centric flag<dd>
0 for centric, 1 for acentric.
<dt> A,B,C,D<dd>
Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients
<dt> Figures of merit<dd>
Figures of merit.
</dl>

<H2><a name="itemnames">Column labels and standard names</H2>

<p>Columns of reflection data in an MTZ file are identified through column labels. 
Through the LABIN/LABOUT mechanism, it is possible to connect a column of data
expected by a particular program with a column of data in a file.</p>

<p>Column labels must be no more than 30 characters long. This limit is hardwired
in the software library used to read and write MTZ files. It is also imposed by
the MTZ format itself, where several details of a particular column must be fitted 
onto a header record of 80 characters.</p>

<p>Column labels should be alphanumeric. Avoid special characters (the "/" in
the standard label "M/ISYM" is a special case - slashes in other places will
break the code).</p>

<p>Although you are free to choose any column labels, the following table lists some
conventional choices:</p>

<table border='5'>
<tr><th> Name</th><th>
Item</th></tr>
<tr><td> H, K, L</td><td>
Miller indices.</td></tr>
<tr><td> M/ISYM</td><td>
Column contains a combination of the partiality flag M and 
the symmetry number ISYM: 256M+ISYM. M is 0 for fully recorded
reflections or 1 for partials. ISYM = 2*isymop - 1 for 
reflections placed in the positive asu, i.e. I+ of a Friedel pair, and
ISYM = 2*isymop for reflections placed in the negative asu, i.e. I- of 
a Friedel pair. Here "isymop" is the number of the symmetry operator used.</td></tr>

<H2><a name="coltypes"></a>Column types</H2>

<p>All columns in an MTZ file are assigned a type, taken from the following list. The LABIN line
of a particular job connects columns in an input MTZ file with the columns expected by the program.
The column types are used to check that a sensible assignment is made, e.g. that you do not try
to use an Intensity (type J) column where a Structure Factor Amplitude (type F) is expected. If there
is a mismatch between file and program column types, a warning will be issued by the CCP4 library.
The allowed column types are as follows:</p>

<table border='5'>
<tr><td> H</td><td>
index h,k,l</td></tr>
<tr><td> J</td><td>
intensity</td></tr>
<tr><td> F</td><td>
structure amplitude, F</td></tr>
<tr><td> D</td><td>
