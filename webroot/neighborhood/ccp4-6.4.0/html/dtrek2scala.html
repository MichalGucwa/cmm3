DTREK2SCALA (CCP4: Supported Program)</h1>

<h2>
NAME</h2>
<b>dtrek2scala </b>- for conversion of integrated intensity and header
files from D*TREK into multi-record mtz files
<h2>
SYNOPSIS</h2>
<b>dtrek2scala hklout</b> <i>foo_out.mtz</i> [Keyworded input]
<h2>
DESCRIPTION</h2>
The program DTREK2SCALA is used for converting reflection data files created
by the program D*TREK. It uses the full goniometric description of the experiment
(encoded in D*TREK header files) to generate a MTZ orientation blocks in
the 'Cambridge' reference frame. The output is a multi-record MTZ file
containing orientation blocks with the crystal and goniostat information:
this file is suitable for input to SCALA for scaling
<br>and is essentially equivalent to the output MTZ of MOSFLM.
<p>The input files must be integrated or profile fitted intensity reflection
files created by dtintegrate/dtprofit (e.g. dtprofit.ref) and the corresponding
d*trek header file created by these programs (e.g. dtintegrate.head)
<h2>
KEY WORDED INPUT</h2>
The various data control lines are identified by keywords with those available
being:

<h3>
<a NAME="ACCEPT"></a>ACCEPT n1 n2 n3 . . . (N.B. NOT WORKING!!!)</h3>
Set flags to accept reflections labelled with error flags n1,n2 etc (cf
REJECT command below). MADNES sets a bit flag for each reflection for error
conditions: this command (and REJECT) allow selection of which classes
of reflection to accept. The flags are as follows:-
<PRE>                      
   Flag   Default        Error
  Number  Setting       Condition
  
     1    accept      Not found (ie weak)
     2    accept      On YMS edge
     3    accept      On ZMS edge
     4    accept      On Phi edge
     5    reject      Too far from YMS
     6    reject      Too far from ZMS
     7    reject      Too far from Phi
     8    reject      Too big in YMS
     9    reject      Too big in ZMS
    10    reject      Too big in Phi
    11    reject      Background bad
    12    reject      Background sd bad
    13    reject      Negative sd
    14    accept      Fobs &lt;= 0.0
    15    reject      Bad pixels
    16    reject      Overflow
</PRE>

<h3>
<a NAME="BATCH"></a>BATCH &lt;batch number> [ &lt;maximum batch number>
]</h3>
Set BATCH number for output file. If the SPLIT option is used (qv), this
will be the first batch number. Remember that batch numbers must be unique
for all batches in an MTZ file. When reading multiple DTREK data reflection
files a separate BATCH command must be used before each PROCESS keyword
otherwise the program will not give the correct performance. Watch out
if using the SPLIT option as well; batch numbers must be unique, and no
check is made of this, so the starting batch number for each group must
be sufficiently well separated. The optional maximum batch number may be
used to avoid having a final batch with very few reflections in it.
<h3>
<a NAME="BTITLE"></a>BTITLE &lt;title></h3>
Set batch title for output MTZ file (defaults = file title TITLE)
<h3>
<a NAME="CRYSTAL"></a>CRYSTAL &lt;crystal_number></h3>
Set crystal number, a number defining a crystal which may contain a number
of batches. This number is not currently used, but may be in future. The
crystal number defaults to the first batch number.
<h3>
<a NAME="FILE"></a>FILE &lt;filename></h3>
Filename for d*trek reflection file. (default = dtprofit.ref).
<h3>
<a NAME="HFILE"></a>HFILE &lt;filename></h3>
Filename for the d*trek header file after the integration/profile fitting
stage. (default = dtintegrate.head) (see example).
<h3>
<a NAME="LIMITS"></a>LIMITS &lt;Ymin> &lt;Ymax> &lt;Zmin> &lt;Zmax></h3>
Set limits on detector position Y,Z for reflection to be accepted This
may be used to exclude reflections near the edge of the detector The default
is not to check detector position.
<h3>
<a NAME="REINDEX"></a>REINDEX &lt;reindexing_rule></h3>
Reindex data, according to a matrix specified in a similar way to symmetry
operations
<PRE>
e.g. reindex   k, h, -l
     reindex   h, -k, -h/2-l/2
</PRE>

Cell dimensions will be recalculated for the redefined cell. Be careful
that the index transformation preserves the hand of the axes, ie that the
matrix has a positive determinant. The program will not allow you to invert
the hand (eg k,h,l is forbidden, k,h,-l is allowed). If the transformation
leads to fractional indices for some cases (as in the 2nd example above),
these reflections will be rejected. If the reindexing operations include
translations, then the orientation data in the output file will not be
strictly correct. Translations (eg h,k,l+1) can be useful if you have misindexed
your crystal by eg 1 lattice point (usually along the spindle axis). However,
in this case, you OUGHT to reprocess the data.
<h3>
<a NAME="REJECT"></a>REJECT n1 n2 n3 . . .</h3>
Set flags to reject reflections labelled with error flags n1,n2 etc (cf
ACCEPT command above).
<h3>
<a NAME="SCALE"></a>SCALE &lt;scale_factor></h3>
Set output scale factor (default = 1.0). This can be adjusted to give intensities
in a suitable range.
<h3>
<a NAME="SPLIT"></a>SPLIT &lt;psi_range></h3>
By default the actual oscillation range per image read from the header
file is used to split the reflection into BATCHes. If &lt;psi-range> is
set then BATCHing is performed accordingly based on the requested psi range.
<h3>
<a NAME="SYMMETRY"></a>SYMMETRY &lt;space-group name | space-group number
| symmetry></h3>
(compulsory)
<p>Read the symmetry operations, specified as the name (eg P212121), the
International Tables number, or as a series of SYMMETRY commands giving
the symmetry operations (eg SYMMETRY X,Y,Z * -X,Y+1/2,-Z)
<p>This last option is not recommended. The symmetry matrices are read
from a standard file (logical name SYMOP), are printed, and are used to
reduce the reflections to an asymmetric unit. The column M/ISYM in the
output file contains the number of the symmetry operation used to do this,
odd numbers correspond to +hkl, even numbers to Bijvoet-related reflections
-hkl. The asymmetric unit is selected according to the rule printed out
with the symmetry
<h3>
<a NAME="TITLE"></a>TITLE &lt;Title></h3>
Set file title for output MTZ file.
<h3>
<a NAME="TOOFAR"></a>TOOFAR &lt;Yshift> &lt;Zshift> &lt;Phishift></h3>
Sets values for the maximum difference between calculated and observed
position for a reflection to be accepted. Yshift and Zshift are in pixels,
Phishift is in degrees. The default is not to do any checks on positional
differences.

<H3> <A NAME="NAME"></A>NAME PROJECT &lt;pname&gt; CRYSTAL &lt;xname&gt; DATASET &lt;dname&gt;</H3>
[Note that the keywords PNAME &lt;pname&gt;, XNAME &lt;xname&gt; and DNAME &lt;dname&gt;
are also available, but the NAME keyword is preferred.]
<p>
Specify the project, crystal and dataset names for the output MTZ file.
It is strongly recommended
that this information is given. Otherwise, the default project, crystal and 
dataset names are "unknown", "unknown" and "unknown&lt;ddmmyy&gt;" respectively
(where &lt;ddmmyy&gt; is the date, with no spaces).
<p>
The project-name specifies a particular structure solution project, the
crystal name specifies a physical crystal contributing to that project, 
and the dataset-name specifies a particular dataset obtained from that
crystal. All three should be given.

<h3>
<a NAME="UGCB"></a>UGCB</h3>
If this keyword is present the D*TREK Goniostat matrix formed from the
DATUM values given in the header keyword CRYSTAL_ORIENT_VALUES will be
included into the UMAT written in to the mtz file batch header. The Goniostat
datum values are consequently set to zero. The default behaviour is for
the Goniostat orientation to be excluded from the UMAT. Scala versions
before scala-3.1.4-beta (22 April 2002) will expect mtz files generated
from DTREK2SCALA using the UGCB option because they make no use of the
Datum values.
<h3>
<a NAME="PROCESS"></a>PROCESS</h3>
(compulsory)
<p>Process the currently-defined input file (from FILE command or logical
name MADHKL).
<h2>
INPUT_FILES</h2>

<h3>
D*TREK</h3>
<b>D*TREK ASCII reflection file</b>
<br>A d*trek reflection file created by dtintegrate or dtprofit (usually
called dtintegrate.ref or dtprofit.ref) must be specified using the FILE
command (see example). If D*TREK is set to produce binary reflection files
then you must first convert the binary file to ASCII using the D*TREK command
<p>dtreflnmerge &lt;input-file> &lt;output-file> -text
<p>The reflection file header provides a description of all the fields
of the reflection file. The header should something like this otherwise
the program may fail to convert correctly.

The relevant fields used by MADNES are described briefly. The reflections 
are listed sequentially in free format.
<p><b>D*TREK header file</b>
<br>The d*trek header file contains a whole lot of information which allows
you to find out just about anything about your experiment (assuming of
course that you and the beamline software remembered to write the correct 
values to the image headers. In principle though, the important information
about the experiment should be correct as it is necessary to correctly
analyse your data and should therefore be available for reading by DTREK2SCALA.
The following is a list of the d*trek header items used by DTREK2SCALA.
If you encounter difficulties in converting your data then checking your
d*trek header file may be a  place to start. The d*trek header file
can also be specified using  the HFILE command. The file is named
dtintegrate.head by default in both d*trek and in DTREK2SCALA.

<b>N.B.</b> The d*trek laboratory frame has X along the omega axis (towards
base plate of goniometer), Z antiparallel to the X-ray beam and  Y
completing a right-handed system. All rotations are right-handed. 
This information is encoded in GONVEC &amp; S0, so these are used to 
define the frame.
