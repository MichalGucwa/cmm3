 NOTICE TO THE LICENSEE

 Please read the following Conditions of Use and the appropriate Licence
 Agreement carefully before completing the installation process and using the
 software. These Conditions and the Licence Agreement are legal documents, and
 together contain information on allowed usage of the software suite, warranty
 information and liability disclaimers. If you do not agree with these
 Conditions, then do not complete the installation and do not use the software.

 These conditions have been updated for release 6.0 of the CCP4 software suite,
 and all sites are required to agree to these conditions of use. You should
 only be prompted for this agreement once.

 The Conditions are as follows:

 a. For commercial users and those doing commercial work:
    Please contact CCP4 at ccp4@ccp4.ac.uk to arrange a commercial licence.
    If you have arranged or renewed a commercial licence in the last 12 months,
    then no action is required. By agreeing to these conditions,
    you confirm that you have a valid and current CCP4 commercial licence. 

 b. For users at non-profit sites and not engaged in commercial work:
    Please print and complete an Academic licence, sign it and post or fax it
    to CCP4 at the address given on the licence (email is not acceptable).
    This licence is valid for 6.0 and subsequent versions until further notice.
    Copies of the licence can be found in a variety of formats in the top
    directory of the CCP4 distribution (files "academic_software_licence.*")
    and on the CCP4 web site at www.ccp4.ac.uk/ccp4license.php . By agreeing
    to these conditions, you confirm that you have returned a licence for CCP4
    version 6.0. It is sufficient to send the licence - there will be no
    confirmation that it has been received.

 I agree to the above conditions and have done the actions required.
