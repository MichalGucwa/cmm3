\section{Introduction}
This document describes the functionality provided by the labelit.distl
wrapper. Labelit.distl is a simple interface to the DISTL library 
(Automated diffraction image analysis and spot searching for 
high-throughput crystal screening, Z. Zhang, N. K. Sauter, 
H. van den Bedem, G. Snell and A. M. Deacon.)

This program produces the following output:

{
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
                     File : 12287_1_E1_001.img
               Spot Total :   1568
      In-Resolution Total :   1421
    Good Bragg Candidates :   1135
                Ice Rings :      2
      Method 1 Resolution :   1.78
      Method 2 Resolution :   1.90
        Maximum unit cell :  242.8
%Saturation, Top 50 Peaks :  14.35

Bin population cutoff for method 2 resolution: 20%
\end{verbatim}
}

That is, the overall number of ``good'' spots and an indicator of the
resolution of the diffraction. This information needs to be provided at
the API layer for image screening.

This output is also provided by the wrapper LabelitStats\_distl which 
provide the output (again) from the last run of distl.
