\section{Introduction}

This document describes the links between the specifications and use cases
for the other program wrappers described in this directory. 

\section{Dependencies}

The following dependencies exist; these must be taken into account when
defining the specifications and use cases for the appropriate program
wrappers and also when it comes to the implementation.

Mosflm is standalone, though could be argued to rely on the Labelit
wrappers.

Sortmtz depends on nothing? or Mtzdump.

Cad depends on nothing? No - it will depend on Mtzdump.

Scala depends on Sortmtz and Cad and Rebatch and Reindex.

Pointless depends on nothing (initially) though to handle input
in other formats will require Combat.
