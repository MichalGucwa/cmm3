    <h1>XIA2 Preferences</h1>

    <p>There may be times when you have a preferences as to how xia2 works -
      you may have programs you trust, or you may know in advance that
      another program may not work. The preferences system will allow for
      this.</p>

    <p>The key to the preferences is to allow global preferences - defined
      in a xia2 directory in your home (the location of which will depend
      on the OS) or in the working directory where you fire up xia2.
      In either case you need to set up a preferences.xia file which
      looks like:</p>

    <pre>
INDEXER: MOSFLM
INTEGRATER: MOSFLM
SCALER: CCP4
    </pre>

    <p>This will specify that you want to use this indexer, even if xia2 would
      by default select a different indexer, for example LABELIT. If you leave
      an element undefined then xia2 will select a sensible choice based on
      compatability with the rest of your selection, for example the choice
      of a CCP4 scaler if you have chosen MOSFLM as the integrater.</p>

    <p>The following keys may be defined within the preferences.xia file:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>INDEXER</li>
      <li>INTEGRATER</li>
      <li>SCALER</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may also comment out lines by having the first character in the
      line as ! or #</p>
