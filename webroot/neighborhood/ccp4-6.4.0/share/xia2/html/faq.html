    <h1>xia2: Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>Will there be a GUI?</h3>

    <p>A CCP4i interface for xia2 is available, which generates xinfo files.
      This is however slightly harder to use than the command line.</p>

    <h3>How long does it take?</h3>

    <p>Because xia2 is quite thorough in the data reduction, it can take
      a little while and also appear to be doing the same thing over and
      over again, for instance integrating a particular sweep. However,
      by it's design each of these jobs is required, and should be making
      the results better. For my test cases, which are reasonably typical
      MAD, SAD and native data sets, anywhere between 30 minutes and four
      hours is typical - however this depends greatly on the computer, where
      the data are stored.</p>

    <h3>What about directories with spaces in?</h3>

    <p>Working from directories with spaces in the path, or in directories
      with spaces in the name may cause problems - generally it is a
      good idea to avoid this if possible. This is a particular problem
      on Windows where things like to live in "Documents and Settings".</p>

    <p>Reducing data from directories with spaces in can have unpredictable
      consequences - often it will work, sometimes it won't, and in those
      timetimes the errors can be cryptic!</p>

    <h3>What detector types are supported?</h3>

    <p>Currently I actively support:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ADSC CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR CCD detectors</li>
      <li>MAR image plate detectors</li>
      <li>RAXIS IV image plate detectors</li>
      <li>Rigaku Saturn CCD detectors</li>
      <li>Pilatus 2M and 6M pixel array detectors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why does it do so many redundant reindexing jobs?</h3>

    <p>Basically because I haven't got around to coding the switches
      to see if the reindexing operator is h,k,l and the input and
      output spacegroup records are identical - this will happen shortly
      though which should reduce the time taken for large data sets.</p>

    <h3>What happens with resolution limits?</h3>

    <p>There are two places where resolution limits are imposed, during
      integration and then during scaling. The integration resolution
      limit is imposed where the measurement of individual reflections
      has an I/sigma of about 1.0. This is applied separately for each
      sweep. The resolution limit from scaling is applied per sweep, and
      is where the overall (merged) I/sigma is about 2.0.</p>

    <h1>Error Questions</h1>

    <h3>What does error getting status meean?</h3>

    <p>This usually - with a CCP4 program - indicates that the output
      has got a little mashed and the status record has been moved.
      This is usually a side-effect of compilation with gfortran, so
      it is probably worth adding</p>

    <pre>
GFORTRAN_UNBUFFERED_ALL=1
    </pre>

    <p>to your environment.</p>
