\section{Introduction}

This document describes the class for storing decisions made by the system.
In this context a decision is a short string, for instance ``The pointgroup
is PG422.'' When a decision is recorded a timestamp is attached. This will 
allow a time-ordered set of decisions to be printed to show what happened.
