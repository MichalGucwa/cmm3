\section{Introduction}

This document describes the IndexerFactory, a module which will provide,
on demand, an Indexer implementation as defined in Schema/Interfaces.

By preference this will produce an implementation which uses Labelit, 
since this is (IMHO) the best\footnote{i.e. most reliable.} indexing 
program. The next will be Mosflm, after that falling to lesser 
Indexer implementations.
