<h1>Major Changes in dbCCP4i</h1>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.11</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbviewer: the menu of available projects is now split into columns of
    30 project names, to ensure that projects at the end of the menu are
    still accessible and don't fall off the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>dbviewer: fix bug whereby zooming out too far caused the display to
    begin zooming back in.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minor optimisation for reading def files for directories and project
    database data.</li>
<li>Bug fix: in certain situations the handler could erroneously discard
    client requests, with the effect that the client might end up waiting
    for the requests to timeout. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbClientAPI.tcl: the time interval for polling the handler lock file
    has been made much shorter, which should hopefully lead to quicker
    start up times for Tcl client applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.10</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug fix: using Python 2.4.4 under Linux, backgrounding a client
    application (e.g. CCP4i) using control-Z and the "bg" command was
    causing dbccp4i to disconnect the client. This should now be
    fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.9</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>OpenProject command could get confused if a request was made to
    open a non-existent project; if a request was made subsequently
    to create a real project then the attempt would fail even though
    it was valid. This is now fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.8</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python unit tests now include basic tests for the history class
    in ccp4i.py.</li>
<li>test_dbsocket.py and test_addfiles.py now added to the
    run_tests.tcl script</li>
<li>test_ccp4i.py: fixed not to leave "test_directories.def.copy"
    lying around in test directory after completing.</li>
<li>New test script "test_directories_client.tcl" added to test
    "GetDirectoriesData" command via the Tcl client API.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>ccp4i.py: all classes and methods should now have doc strings
    for improved Python documentation.</li>
<li>Fixed bugs which meant that the -debug and -shutdown options of
    dbccp4i didn't work in earlier versions.</li>
<li>dbccp4i returns a non-zero exit status in the event that one of
    the modules that it needs fails to load.</li>
<li>New handler API command "GetDirectoriesData" allows multiple
    data items to be retrieved for project and data dir information
    in a single request.</li>
<li>Minor fix to GetDataDir command, which should be quicker as it
    doesn't check whether the supplied alias is a project before
    attempting to look it up as a data directory; the return
    status should now correctly be ERROR if the alias is not
    found.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated the "Communication Protocols" documentation
    (communications.html) with more information about broadcast
    messages from the handler.</li>
<li>Added "GetDirectoriesData" commands to the Tcl and Python client
    APIs, corresponding to the new handler API command with the same
    name.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.7.2 / 0.4.7.1</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Various updates to test scripts to improve robustness.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented changes to try and improve performance on systems where
    file access operations become expensive if performed many times
    (reported for some setups using NFS).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbClientAPI.tcl,.py: fixed to function correctly for installations
    of dbccp4i which have spaces in the pathname (for example, under
    Windows).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.6</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>test_directories_mr.py: removed the dependence on PYTHONPATH to locate
    the required Python modules.</li>
<li>dbitem_client.tcl: new test script checks that the data items available
    in the database are consistent with that in database.def.</li>
<li>dbviewer: the "Output Tracking XML" option was broken under Windows if
    the output XML filename contained spaces - should now be fixed.</li>
<li>reaper: new client application that can be used to analyse a project
    database to extract information for data harvesting. Reaper can be
    run from the command line or by selecting the appropriate option in
    dbviewer when right-clicking on a job.</li>
<li>Demonstration SQLite crystallographic database: files for an example
    CCP4i task interface are provided in the "tasks" subdirectory
    (bioxhit_db.tcl and bioxhit_db.def) which allows interaction with an
    existing SQLite database associated with a project. The files must be
    copied to $CCP4/ccp4i/tasks and then the interface can be launched
    using "ccp4i -t bioxhit_db", or via the option from the viewer (under
    the "File" menu).</li>
<li>Tests will only run if an existing handler instance isn't already
    running for the user running the test suite.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbccp4i.setup-dist,-bash: no longer adds paths to the PYTHONPATH
    environment variable - applications should explicitly specify the
    location of the required modules.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in handler which meant that dbccp4i ran forever under
    Windows, and could only be stopped by killing the python process.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>New data items added to the database: MACHINE and USER_AGENT; also,
    USER_AGENT is now automatically stored by the handler for new jobs and
    subjobs, and takes its value as the name supplied by the client
    application when it first connected.</li>
<li>It is now possible to extend the .def file database with new items
    by adding definitions for those items in the template database.def
    ($DBCCP4I_TOP/etc/database.def).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.5</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>test_directories_mr.py: new test script added which checks that it
    possible to connect to a handler with non-standard directories.def
    file from the Python client API.</li>
<li>run_tests.tcl: fixed problem that Python unit test always reported
    failure, even if all unit tests worked.</li>
<li>dbccp4i_test_client.tcl: added a simple test for subjob addition.</li>
<li>dbviewer: a number of changes:
    <ul>
    <li>Options to view the "annotated" logfile and to run "plugins"
        such as Coot and CCP4mg have been added to the job options
        menus.</li>
    <li>A number of small bugs with selection and filtering have been
        fixed as a result of refactoring the code. The viewer should now
        also be a little more stable.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>starKey: fixed a number of issues:
    <ul>
    <li>Now possible to run starKey in an environment where PYTHONPATH
        doesn't include the appropriate directories for the client
        API and other modules (previously failed with an ImportError).</li>
    <li>Previously would fail to generate XML file if it encountered a
        logfile which contained unrecognised program output (e.g. from
        programs that don't follow the CCP4 logfile conventions
        recognised by smartie) - now fixed.</li>
    <li>smartie: updated to version 0.0.14.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug where attempting start up of a handler with non standard
    directories.def from the Python client API would always fail to
    create a handler instance.</li>
<li>Control-C to kill a client application that started the handler
    in background should not now also kill the handler process. (In fact
    it should not be possible to kill the handler process using
    Control-C at all.)</li>
<li>Fixed some bugs when running the handler with Python 2.5.2: on Linux,
    suspending and backgrounding the client that started the handler
    no longer results in the connection being dropped.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>AddSubJob command (dbClientAPI.tcl, dbClientAPI.py): the "taskname"
    and "title" arguments supplied to the AddSubJob commands have been
    reversed (essentially correcting an old bug in the handler). Also,
    a bug in the Tcl client API (whereby only the first word in the title
    was actually used) has been corrected.</li>
<li>HasJobs command (dbClientAPI.tcl): now returns zero if the handler
    returns an error, rather than an empty string.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.4</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbccp4i_test_client.tcl: added tests for set/get of data for a single
    job.</li>
<li>dbccp4i_test_client.py and dbsocket_crash.py: now explicitly appends the
    ClientAPI and dbccp4i directories to the module search path, so that the
    tests will run in environments where these directories are not part of
    the PYTHONPATH.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed DbGetData command which was broken in 0.4.3 (would always generate
    a handler exception warning if multiple data items were requested in a
    single request to the handler).</li>
<li>Trap for existence of directories.def or database.def file before
    attempting to check modification status, which should prevent errors if
    .CCP4 area or project directory is removed while handler is running.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbClientAPI.tcl: missing .CCP4 directory in user's home area no longer
    crashes the client API due to being unable to make a logging file
    there.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.3</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>No changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>The "operation" reported in broadcast messages has been updated for
    NewProject, DeleteProject, ImportProject, AddDataDirRef and
    DeleteDataDirRef.</li>
<li>Warnings are now suppressed if a project is opened which has mismatching
    header information for the project name or directories.</li>
<li>DbGetData command: better handling of cases when requested job id
    and/or data item(s) don't exist. Note that if several data items are
    requested, if even one doesn't exist then the request as a whole will
    fail and return an error.</li>
<li>DbSetData command: better handling of cases when requested job id
    and/or data item(s) don't exist. Note that if several data items are
    requested, if one doesn't exist then the returned status will be
    ambiguious.</li>
<li>AddOutputFile command: better handling of case when requested job id
    doesn't exist.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tcl client API: the default timeout has been increased to 30 seconds.
    This should be sufficient to deal with large projects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.2</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>tests: new platform-independent script run_tests.tcl, which runs all
    test scripts and reports outcomes (replaces run_tests.sh, which has been
    withdrawn).</li>
<li>tests: new diagnostic test script dbccp4i_diagnose.tcl has been added,
    which attempts to characterise the interactions with the handler.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>DbInfo: now includes information on the Python interpreter that the
    handler is running under, as well as the handler version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbClientAPI.tcl: Fixed bug in "namespace exists" workaround which stopped
    the API from working properly if sourced more than once.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4.1</h2>

<h3>DBviewer and applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>New command line option for DBviewer: -title allows custom text
    to be added to the title bar, e.g.<br />
    dbviewer -title "viewing MrBUMP"</li>
<li>Python dbconsole: new -directories option allows the user to
    specify a non-default directories.def file to user on start-up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbClientAPI.py: Connect command supports -directories option,
    to specify a non-default directories.def file to user on start-up.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.4</h2>


<h3>DBviewer</h3>
<ul>
<li>New command line options:
    <ul>
    <li>-directories: allows an arbitrary non-default directories.def
        file to be specified on start-up.</li>
    <li>-remote: allows the specification of a remote handler that the
        viewer should use instead of one on localhost (the default).</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Updated to work with CCP4 6.1 as well as CCP4 6.0.2.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented -directories option, to specify an arbitrary non-default
    directories.def file to use on start-up.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in the DeleteProject command: now it is not possible to
    delete a reference to a project while it is open.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in the ImportProject command: now it is not possible to
    import a project unless it has a unique name and directory path. Also
    the import will fail if the directory is not a valid project
    directory.</li>
<li>Fixed bug when adding projects, that project database directory path
    would be left blank if not explicitly specified (caused problems if
    CCP4i subsquently tried opening the project directly).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>dbClientAPI.tcl: DbHandlerConnect command supports -directories option,
    to specify a non-default directories.def file to user on start-up.</li>
<li>dbClientAPI.tcl: Fixed bugs in db_client_error which meant that no
    error messages were ever retrieved, and added a new command called
    db_client_response_data which allows the status and result from the last
    handler interaction to be returned</li>
</ul>


<h2>Changes in Version 0.3</h2>


<h3>DBviewer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add an icon on the job node. If a job has subjobs, in the upper left
    side, a star '*' is shown. </li>
<li>Add an up arrow, allow to go from subjob view to top lever job view.</li>
<li>Replaced textual buttons on tool bar with a set of icons e.g. for zooming
    in/zooming out etc.</li>
<li>Uses colour scheme from CCP4i if user has specified custom colours in
    CCP4i.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added support for subjobs: it is possible to create jobs within jobs, to
    represent substeps of a larger process (for example, automated
    pipeline).</li>
<li>Added implementation of demonstration SQLite knowledge base.</li>
<li>Large number of bugs addressed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client API</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added namespacing to Tcl client API: prepend ::dbClientAPI:: to commands
    or use namespace import.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where Tcl client API failed if sourced more than once.</li>
<li>Tcl and Python client APIs updated with commands for interacting with
    subjobs.</li>
<li>Tcl client API has functions for interacting with generic SQLite tables,
    plus additional functions for interacting with demonstration knowledge
    base.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in Version 0.2</h2>
<p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tested on Windows.</li>

in the job node.</li>
<li>Add an icon at lower right hand side on job node. If the 'JobQuality' is 1, the icon is a tick;
if the 'JobQuality' is -1, the icon is a cross; if the 'JobQuality' is 0, the
icon is a question mark.</li>
<li>Add Zoom in(+)/Zoom out(-) button. </li>

</ul>
<h3>DB handler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added 'AddInputFile', 'AddOutputFile', 'ListInputFiles','ListOutputFiles',

the actural result. If handler response is 'ERROR', API raises 'DBError'
exception. </li>
<li>In python API,Change DbRegister, now it takes two arguments, user_agent and broadcast flag.</li>
<li>In python API, changes in handler connection: 
Remove 'DbStartHander' & 'DbRegister'. HandlerConnection initialisation takes
two arguments: user agent and broadcast flag.  
There are major changes in the name of the methods/procedures. The following
