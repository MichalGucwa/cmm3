<h1>CCP4/BIOXHIT: CCP4i Tracking Database Schema</h1>

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines the specification of the CCP4i project tracking
database. It is based on the project database used in CCP4i and is geared
towards tracking runs of software initiated through CCP4i. Later revisions
of the schema will be more generic to allow a better description of
non-CCP4i initiated software runs.</p>

<p>The sections below contain the following information: section 2 gives
an abstract description of the tracking database schema; sections 3 and 4
describe attempts at concrete implementations of the schema in CCP4i
def file format and SQL tables respectively.</p>

<h2>2 Description of the tracking database schema</h2>

<h3>2.1 Overview</h3>

<p>CCP4i divides the user's work into <b>projects</b>. A user
can have as many projects as they wish. The schematic diagram below
gives a picture of how the data is imagined in a simple hierarchy.</p>

<pre>
                 User
                  +
                  |
                  |
   Projects +-----+-----+ Default dirs
      |                         |
      +- Name                   +- Name
      +- Directory              +- Directory
      +- Database subdirectory
                  |
                  +- Job Database
</pre>

<h3>2.2 Projects</h3>

<p>A <b>project</b> in this model consists very simply of a file directory
or folder plus an associated job database which is used to store
information about program runs. There is no formal definition of what
constitutes a project beyond this, and users are free to define new
projects to subdivide their work and organise their data as they wish.</p>

<p>A project has the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>project name</em> (also called an <em>alias</em>)</li>
<li>An associated <em>project directory</em></li>
<li>A <em>database subdirectory</em> with the project directory
    (conventionally called <tt>CCP4_DATABASE</tt>)</li>
<li>A job database</li>
</ul>

<p>The job database contains job records. A job is a run of a software
application or task, which can be a single program or a script that
runs many programs in some sequence. The data items associated with each
each job record are given in the tables below in the section <em>Job
Records</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to none or more job records, the job database also has a
data item called NJOBS. This is actually the current highest job id number
in the database, and not necessarily the total number of jobs.</p>

<h3>2.3 Default Directories ("Def Dirs")</h3>

<p>A <b>default directory</b> (also called a "def dir") has name (also called
an "alias") and an associated directory, but no database subdirectory or job
database.</p>

<p>A normal use of a def dir is as a convenient way to refer to a
directory containing source data.</p>

<h3>2.4 Job records</h3>

<p>A <b>job</b> represents the run of a software application. Typically
this is a task in CCP4i, however in principle it could be a run of
any program or script. The following sections describe the data that are
with each job in the schema.</p>

<h4>2.4.1 Data associated with job records</h4>

<p>Each job has a number of associated data items that are described in
the following table.</p>

<table border=2>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Name</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Description</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Type</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JOB_ID</td>
<td><p>The job number is a unique integer value assigned to each job in
    the project's job database, starting from 1 and increasing
    monotonically. It is used as the primary key for identifying records
    within the job database.</p></td>
<td>Positive integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DATE</td>
<td><p>The date of the last change to the job record, in "epoch" format
    i.e. the number of seconds that have elapsed since the system's
    (arbitrary) start time.</p></td>
<td>Date (positive integer)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TASKNAME</td>
<td><p>The name of the CCP4i task or other application which created
    the job when it ran.</p></td>
<td>Text (no whitespace)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STATUS</td>
<td><p>The current state of the job, indicating that it is either in
    progress, or the broad condition under which it terminated.
    The status of a job indicates the state of the job process,
    rather than indicating the quality of the output.<br />
    See below for the possible values and their meanings.</p></td>
<td>Enumerated type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TITLE</td>
<td><p>A descriptive user-defined title for the job run. This provides
    simple annotation of the job records to help to distinguish
    between different runs of the same task.</p></td>
<td>Text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LOGFILE</td>
<td><p>The name of the principle logfile associated with the job.
    Only the filename is specified, the file is assumed to be
    held in the project directory.<br />
    Typically CCP4i constructs the logfile names for a particular
    job using the following convention:</p>
    <p><tt><em>[JOB_ID]_[TASKNAME].log</em></tt></p>
    <p>However this is a convention and not a general requirement for
    logfile naming.</p></td>
<td>Filename</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RUNFILE</td>
<td><p>The name of a "control file" that was used to run the job,
    for example a shell script.</p>
    <p>It is possible for a job not to have the RUNFILE set; it
    currently used when the user adds the report of a jobs run
    from outside CCP4i.</p></td>
<td>Filename</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCRATCH</td>
<td><p>The name of the temporary or "scratch" directory for the
    job.</p></td>
<td>Directory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INPUT_FILES</td>
<td><p>A list of the names of files that were used as input to the job.
    Items in the list are separated by whitespace characters, and
    can either be filenames without a path, in which case they are
    assumed to reside in one of the project or def dir directories
    (specified in the INPUT_FILES_DIR), or alternatively the file
    may be specified by the full path.</p>
    <p>See section 2.4.3 for details of how the filenames and
    directories are stored and recovered.</p></td>
<td>List of filenames</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INPUT_FILES_DIR</td>
<td><p>A list of the project or def dir names corresponding to the
    locations of the files in the INPUT_FILES list.
    Items in the list are separated by whitespace characters.</p>
    <p>See section 2.4.3 for details of how the filenames and
    directories are stored and recovered.</p>
    </td>
<td>List of directory specifiers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INPUT_FILES_STATUS</td>
<td><p>A list of "file status" signifiers for each file in the
    INPUT_FILES list. This is not used and the signifiers are
    currently undefined.</p></td>
<td>List of text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OUTPUT_FILES</td>
<td><p>A list of the names of files that were created as
    output from the job.
    Items in the list are separated by whitespace characters, and
    can either be filenames without a path, in which case they are
    assumed to reside in one of the project or def dir directories
    (specified in the OUTPUT_FILES_DIR), or alternatively the file
    may be specified by the full path.</p>
    <p>See section 2.4.3 for details of how the filenames and
    directories are stored and recovered.</p></td>
<td>List of filenames</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OUTPUT_FILES_DIR</td>
<td><p>A list of the project or def dir names corresponding to the
    locations of the files in the OUTPUT_FILES list.
    Items in the list are separated by whitespace characters.</p>
    <p>See section 2.4.3 for details of how the filenames and
    directories are stored and recovered.</p>
    </td>
<td>List of directory specifiers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OUTPUT_FILES_STATUS</td>
<td><p>A list of "file status" signifiers for each file in the
    OUTPUT_FILES list. This is not used and the signifiers are
    currently undefined.</p></td>
<td>List of text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PARAMETER_FILE</td>
<td><p>The name of the CCP4i def-format file which contains the
    parameters and values used to run a CCP4i task.</p>
    <p>It is possible for jobs not to have an associated
    parameter file, for example reported jobs.</p></td>
<td>Filename</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NOTEBOOK_FILE</td>
<td><p>The name of an ASCII text file with free text typically
    used to store annotation or notes on the job.</p>
    <p>It is possible for jobs not to have an associated
    notebook file, as these files are only created by an
    application when adding a new notebook entry.</p></td>
<td>Filename</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the implementations described in the later sections of
this document do not necessarily conform to this description at
present.</p>

<h4>2.4.2 Job Status Values and Meanings</h4>

<p>The table gives the possible values for the STATUS data item in
a job record:</p>

<table border=2>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Value</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Description/meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STARTING</td>
<td>The job has been registered but the process is not yet
    running</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RUNNING</td>
<td>The job process is currently running on the system</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FINISHED</td>
<td>The job process terminated without raising any system
    errors or non-zero termination status</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FAILED</td>
<td>The job process terminated with a system error or
    with a non-zero termination status</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>KILLED</td>
<td>The user initiated premature termination of the job
    process from within CCP4i</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ON_HOLD</td>
<td>A special status used in auto-testing; the job is
    scheduled to begin at a later time, under some condition
    determined by CCP4i/client application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>REPORTED</td>
<td>The job process ran under some other system and the
    user has recorded the details retrospectively</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>2.4.3 Input and output filename storage and recovery</h4>

<p>The information about references to input and output files
associated with jobs are stored in the INPUT_FILES and
INPUT_FILES_DIR data items for input files, and OUTPUT_FILES
and OUTPUT_FILES_DIR for output files.</p>

<p>INPUT_FILES is a list of filenames and INPUT_FILES_DIR
is a list of corresponding project or def dir names, so that
the i'th project name in the INPUT_FILES list is associated
with the i'th filename in the INPUT_FILES_DIR. This is the
same for the OUTPUT_FILES and OUTPUT_FILES_DIR lists also.</p>

<p>For files that are stored in a directory that is also a
project or def dir, usually only the name of the file is stored
without the leading directory path, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
<b>INPUT_FILES:  INPUT_FILES_DIR</b>
toxd.mtz      TOXD
</pre>

<p>The full path is constructed by acquiring the directory path
for the project and then appending the filename, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
/home/pjx/Projects/toxd/toxd.mtz
</pre>

<p>For files that are not in a project or def dir directory,
the full filename is recorded in the INPUT_FILES or OUTPUT_FILES
list, and the corresponding name in the ..._DIR entry is given
as either <tt>FULL_PATH</tt> or as an "empty" entry <tt>{}</tt>,
e.g.:</p>

<pre>
<b>INPUT_FILES:                   INPUT_FILES_DIR:</b>
/home/pjx/NotAProject/toxd.mtz FULL_PATH
</pre>

<p>Additionally, references to directories can also be stored.
In this case the filename in the INPUT_FILES or OUTPUT_FILES
list is an "empty" entry <tt>{}</tt> and the corresponding
entry in the ..._DIR list is the full directory path, e.g.:</p>

<pre>
<b>INPUT_FILES:      INPUT_FILES_DIR:</b>
{}                /home/pjx/arbitrary/dir/
</pre>

<h2>3 Implementation in CCP4i def file format</h2>

<p>The above data model has been implemented in CCP4i and in dbCCP4i
in the CCP4i def file format.</p>

<h3>3.1 Overview of the CCP4i def file format</h3>

<p>Def files use a simple flat file data storage format in ASCII
text. A line in a def file will be one of:

<ul>
<li>A CCP4i header line, beginning with the text <tt>#CCP4I</tt>,</li>
<li>A parameter-value pair,</li>
<li>A parameter-type-value triplet (nb in any given file there will
    either pairs or triplets for all parameters - these two forms are
    not normally mixed),</li>
<li>An "include" directive, of the form <tt>@filename</tt> (which
    instructs the processor to insert the contents of the specified file
    at this point,</li>
<li>A comment line, beginning with the hash symbol (#), or</li>
<li>A blank line, consisting of white space only.</li>
</ul>

<p>The parameter-value pair lines have the form:</p>

<pre>
PARAMETER      value
</pre>

<p>The parameter-type-value triplets have the form:</p>

<pre>
PARAMETER      type      value
</pre>

<p>The elements on each line are separated by whitespace. Parameter
names are conventionally uppercased and consist of alphanumeric
characters and underscores only. Values can be arbitrary strings or
numbers, however they must be enclosed in double quotes if they
contain whitespace.</p>

<p>(The types are defined in the $CCP4/etc/types.def file distributed
with the CCP4 suite.)</p>

<p>"Indexed" parameters provide structures similar to one and
two-dimensional arrays. An indexed parameter is defined using the
"zeroeth" element:</p>

<pre>
PARAMETER,0
</pre>

<p>The comma (",") indicates that it is an indexed parameter - the
index is the part after the the comma. Single indexed parameters have
the form:</p>

<pre>
PARAMETER,<em>i</em>
</pre>

<p>where <em>i</em> is an integer and counts from 1 upwards. Double
indexed parameters have
the form:</p>

<pre>
PARAMETER,<em>i</em>_<em>j</em>
</pre>

<p>where <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are both integers and counting up
from 1. Note that although the "zeroeth" element is only singly
indexed, it also defines doubly indexed parameters i.e. it is only
necessary to use <tt>PARAMETER,0</tt> (not <tt>PARAMETER,0_0</tt>).</p>

<h3>3.2 Project and directory definitions: <tt>directories.def</tt></h3>

<p>The data defining an individual user's projects and def dirs
is stored in a file called <tt>directories.def</tt>. The def file
"schema" is:</p>

<pre>
N_PROJECTS              _positiveint1           1
PROJECT_ALIAS,0         _text                   ""
PROJECT_PATH,0          _dir                    ""
PROJECT_DB,0            _dir                    ""
PROJECT_ALIAS,1         _text                   PROJECT
PROJECT_PATH,1          _dir                    ""
PROJECT_DB,1            _dir                    ""
N_DEF_DIRS              _positiveint1           1
DEF_DIR_PATH,0          _dir                    ""
DEF_DIR_ALIAS,0         _text                   ""
DEF_DIR_PATH,1          _dir                    \$CCP4_SCR
DEF_DIR_ALIAS,1         _text                   TEMPORARY
</pre>

<p>(See also $CCP4/ccp4i/etc/directories.def.dist. Note that the file
contains other parameters used by CCP4i for internal purposes, however
they are not part of the database model and so are not described here.)</p>

<p>The table below describes what each of these parameters represents:</p>

<table border=2>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Parameter</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N_PROJECTS</td>
<td>Total number of projects defined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROJECT_ALIAS,i</td>
<td>The name/alias of the i'th project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROJECT_PATH,i</td>
<td>The directory path of the i'th project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PROJECT_DB,i</td>
<td>The database subdirectory of the i'th project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N_DEF_DIRS</td>
<td>Total number of def dirs defined.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DEF_DIR_PATH,i</td>
<td>The directory path of the i'th def dir.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DEF_DIR_ALIAS,i</td>
<td>The name/alias of the i'th def dir.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each user has their own <tt>directories.def</tt> file, which
resides in a subdirectory in their home area. On UNIX or Linux
systems this is:</p>

<pre>
$HOME/.CCP4/unix/directories.def
</pre>

<h3>3.3 Job database: <tt>database.def</tt></h3>

<p>The <tt>database.def</tt> file in the project database subdirectory
holds the job database data for that project. The def file
"schema" is:</p>

<pre>
NJOBS                   _positiveint            0
TASKNAME,0              _text                   ""
DATE,0                  _date                   ""
STATUS,0                _db_status              ""
LOGFILE,0               _log_file               ""
RUNFILE,0               _run_file               ""
SCRATCH,0               _dir                    ""
TITLE,0                 _text                   ""
INPUT_FILES,0           _list_of_files          ""
INPUT_FILES_DIR,0       _list_of_files          ""
INPUT_FILES_STATUS,0    _list_of_text           ""
OUTPUT_FILES,0          _list_of_files          ""
OUTPUT_FILES_DIR,0      _list_of_files          ""
OUTPUT_FILES_STATUS,0   _list_of_text           ""
</pre>

<p>(See also $CCP4/ccp4i/etc/database.def.)</p>

<p>Note that the <tt>NJOBS</tt> data item is actually the current
highest job id number in the database, and not necessarily the total
number of jobs.</p>

<p>Not all data items outlined in the schema are explicitly
defined in this implementation (this is for consistency with CCP4i).
The following data items are implicitly defined:</p>

<table border=2>
<tr>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Implicit Data Item</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JOB_ID</td></p>
<td><p>JOB_ID is not explicitly stored in the database.def file, it is an
    implicit property of the job record. For example, the date for
    job number 34 is stored in parameter <tt>DATE,34</tt>, while the
    title of job 102 is in <tt>TITLE,102</tt>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PARAMETER_FILE</td>
<td><p>Parameter filenames are implicitly constructed using the
    following convention:</p>
    <p><tt><em>[JOB_ID]_[TASKNAME].def</em></tt></p>
    <p>and conventionally these files are placed in the database
    subdirectory of the project directory.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NOTEBOOK_FILE</td>
<td><p>Notebook filenames are not explicitly stored and are
    instead constructed using the following convention:</p>
    <p><tt><em>[JOB_ID]_notebook.def</em></tt></p>
    <p>Conventionally these files are placed in the database
    subdirectory of the project directory.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>4 Implementation in SQL tables</h2>

<p>A version of the tracking data model has also been implemented
in a set of linked SQL tables.</p>

<h3>4.1 Project tracking SQL schema</h3>

<h4>4.1.4 "JobFile" table</h4>

<p>This table holds the associations of files with jobs. Each
row in the table links a file to a particular job, as either
an input or output file. While a particular file can only be
linked to a single job as an output file, it can be linked to
many jobs as a input file.</p>

<tr>
<td>JobId</td>
<td>The id number of a job in the "Job" table, which forms
    the first part of the link.</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>1, 2, 3, ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FileId</td>
<td>The id number of a file in the "File" table, which forms
    the second part of the link.</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>1, 2, 3, ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>The character of the relationship between the job and
    the file, i.e. either "input" or "output".</td>
<td>Varchar</td>
<td>Either "input" or "output" only</td>
</tr>

<h4>4.1.5 "JobLink" table</h4>

<p>This table relates two job records together to record
some kind of sequence of jobs. Note that this is not part of the
original specification.</p>

<tr>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Attributes</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Description</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Data Type</th>
<th bgcolor="lightgray">Example</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>JobId</td>
<td>The id number of the job in the "Job" table which is
    the first job in the link.</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>1, 2, 3, ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NextJobId</td>
<td>The id number of the job in the "Job" table which is
    the second job in the link.</td>
<td>Integer</td>
<td>1, 2, 3, ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Note</td>
<td>Annotation attached to the link (similar to the "notebook"
    text for a job).</td>
<td>Varchar</td>
<td>"Phasing procedure"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Type</td>
<td>The relationship between the two jobs: either "logical"
    (the relationship is due to application or procedural
    logic) or "data" (there is a flow of data, for example
    a shared file, between the jobs).</td>
<td>Varchar</td>
<td>Either "logic" or "data" only</td>

<h3>4.2 Differences between the def file and SQL implementations</h3>

<p>The SQL tables describe a centralised database, where all data
is held in the same database (for example, all the user's job
records are stored in a single "Job" table, with an attribute to
specify which project they belong to) whereas the def file
implementation describes a distributed database (all job records
and data for one project is kept separate from all others).</p>

<p>A distributed database is flexible and relatively robust; the
centralised approach offers the option to easily change associations
and draw links between data and jobs in different projects.</p>

<p>The SQL tables also define explicit links between jobs which do
not appear in the original description, but which are needed for a
fuller description of project history.</p>
