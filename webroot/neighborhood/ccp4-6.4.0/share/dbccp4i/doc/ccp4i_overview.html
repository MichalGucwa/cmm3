<h1>ccp4i.py: overview</h1>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<h3>database</h3>

<p>Implements a CCP4i def file based database. Requires that
the CCP4 environment is set up in order to work. Usage example:
</p>

<pre>
d = ccp4i.database("PROJECT","/home/pjx/PROJECTS/myProject") # Instantiate a database
                                                             # object
d.open()            # Open the database and lock the source file
d.open(force=True)  # Open the database, overriding any lock

d.save()            # Save the database contents to the source file
d.close()           # Close the database, saving contents and releasing the lock
</pre>

<p>This is not the full range of methods.</p>

<h3>lockfile</h3>

<p>Implements a general CCP4i-type lockfile, which can be
associated with arbitrary file-based resources. Used by the
directories class, and as the base class for the dblockfile
class. Should not be required directly.</p>

<h3>dblockfile</h3>

<p>An extension of the lockfile class that provides the
specific lockfile functionality for the database.def files
of the database class. It is used by the database class.
Should not be required directly.</p>

<h3>directories</h3>

<p>Provides methods for reading and writing directories.def.
Requires that the CCP4 environment is set up in order to work.
Usage example:</p>

<pre>
d = ccp4i.directories() # Instantiate a directories object that will use
                        # user's default directories.def fiel
d = ccp4i.directories(filen="./directories.def") # As above but use the named file

d.load()                # Load the data and lock the file
d.load(force=True)      # Load the data and grab any existing lock

d.listprojects()        # Return a list of the project names
% ['CSTAFF', 'JUNK', 'RCSB_DEMOS', 'CHOOCH', 'PROJECT', ...

d.projectdir("PROJECT") # Return the directory path for a project
% '/home/pjx/PROJECTS/myProject'

d.save(filen="...")     # Save data to the named file
d.release()             # Finish using the data; release the lock on the base file
</pre>

<p>These are not the whole range of methods. Also the save
and release methods haven't been fully thought out yet so may
not behave as expected. The directories class should probably
also support a "read-only" mode, and a "refresh" operation
(which would re-read the data from the source file).

<h3>array</h3>

<p>Implements an interface to CCP4i .def files. This class is
used in the database and directories classes to interface to
the underlying def files. Should not be required directly at
present.</p>

<h3>history</h3>

<p>Provides methods for generating "history links" between jobs
in a CCP4i database object.</p>

<h2>Known problems/Things to be fixed</h2>

<ol>
<li>CCP4 environment is required to use the database and directories
    classes, and fails otherwise.</li>
</ol>
