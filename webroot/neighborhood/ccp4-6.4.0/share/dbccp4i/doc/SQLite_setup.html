<h1>SQLite for dbCCP4i: installation notes</h1>

<p>These are notes on how to install SQLite and the Python interface to
use the SQLite backend for dbCCP4i.</p>

<h2>Packages to be installed</h2>

<p>Obtain the SQLite package from the <b>SQLite download page:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">http://www.sqlite.org/download.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Obtain the Python DB-API interface for SQLite from <b>pysqlite download page:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://initd.org/tracker/pysqlite">http://initd.org/tracker/pysqlite</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a <b>pysqlite installation guide</b> at:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Installation procedure for Linux (ad hoc)</h2>

<p>Pysqlite requires the installation of the SQLite libraries (version 3.3.2 or
better). I downloaded the source code of the source tree for SQLite version 3.3.4
from
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">http://www.sqlite.org/download.html</a>.
The installation instructions in the README file suggested that I should do the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unpack the targz file (into the sqlite-3.3.4 directory)</li>
<li>Make a new directory parallel to this to perform the build in (e.g. mkdir
    build-sqlite-3.3.4)</li>
<li>Change to this directory and execute the sqlite configure (e.g.
    ../sqlite-3.3.4/configure)
<li>Note that the default install location is /usr/local/ - you can over-ride
    this using the --prefix=... configure flag (I used this to install in a local
    area). You can also use the --with-tcl=... configure flag to set the location
    of the Tcl installation (I didn't do this).
<li>Run make/make install to build and install.
</ol>

<p>For the Python bindings, Python 2.3 or better is required (in addition to having
SQLite installed).</p>

<p>I downloaded pysqlite 2.1.3. As SQLite is installed in a non-standard location
I had to edit the setup.cfg file to point to where the header files and libraries
have been installed. Then I ran "python setup.py build" from the pysqlite-2.1.3
directory, but go the following error:</p>

<pre>
[pjx@ccp4t pysqlite-2.1.3]$ python setup.py build

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This script requires setuptools version 0.6a9 to run (even to display
help).  I will attempt to download it for you (from
http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/2.3/s/setuptools/), but
you may need to enable firewall access for this script first.
I will start the download in 15 seconds.

</pre>

<p>Try 2.0.7 instead ... however this gave the same errors. The following link
<a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools</a> gives a clue - it suggests that the minimum Python
version for setuptools on 64-bit platforms is 2.4.</p>

<p>I downloaded Python 2.4.3 from 
<a href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a> and
installed in a local area, then tried the 2.1.3 version of pysqlite - this time
it appeared to compile without problems. I ran "python setup.py install" to
install in the same area as the SQLite installation.</p>

<p>I then ran the tests as recommended in the installation document. Because I
have installed everything in non-standard places, I needed to add the bin and lib
directories to my PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variables respectively.</p>
