<h1>Test procedures for dbCCP4i</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document gives an overview of test procedures for the CCP4i
project database handler "dbccp4i" and the underlying code. The tests
are divided into different types:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#scripted_tests">Scripted tests</a>: these are the mainstay
    for validating the behaviour of the system.</li>
<li><a href="#manual_tests">Manual test procedures</a>: these are early
    test procedures that use the dbconsole. They are retained here as they
    may occasionally be of use, however they are not generally used now.</li>
<li><a href="#other_tools">Other test tools</a>: these are additional
    tools that can be of help in diagnosing problems, but like the manual
    tests are not generally used now.</li>
</ul>

<a name="scripted_tests"></a>
<h2>Scripted Tests</h2>

<p>There are a number of test scripts in the <tt>test</tt> directory
of the dbccp4i distribution.</p>

<p>A Tcl wrapper script called <tt>run_tests.tcl</tt> is provided which
runs all the test scripts, and reports any failures. It is invoked from
the command line with:</p>

<pre>
% tclsh run_tests.tcl
</pre>

<p>however it is possible to invoke it from any location provided that 
the appropriate path to the script is provided. The wrapper script uses
helper scripts located in the <tt>test/helper</tt> subdirectory.</p>

<p>The tests should run on both Unix and Windows platforms. Note that the
wrapper script will refuse to run if it detects a dbccp4i process already
running. This is to prevent the tests from interfering with the operation
of other existing client applications, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Note also that the tests currently use the existing directories.def
file of the user that runs them - so if the tests fail, in the worst
cases references to the test directories may be left behind. This should
not be a problem however the user will at some point need to remove
the references manually.</p>

<p>The following sections outline the test scripts that are included in
the test directory and which are run by the wrapper script. They can also
be run standalone.</p>

<h3>Basic Python Tests</h3>

<table class="TestScripts">
<tr>
<td>test_ccp4i.py</td>
<td><p>Test functions for the classes and methods in the ccp4i.py module,
    built using the Python <tt>unittest</tt> module.</p>
   <p>Usage: <tt>% python test_ccp4i.py</tt></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test_dbsocket.py</td>
<td><p>Unit tests that check the classes and functions in dbsocket.py directly
    (specifically, the XML wrapping and unwrapping functions), built using
    the Python <tt>unittest</tt> module.</p>
    <p>Usage: <tt>% python test_dbsocket.py</tt></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dbccp4i_test_client.py</td>
<td>A simple client test application that tries basic operations via
    the Python client API.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Basic Tcl Tests</h3>

<table class="TestScripts">
<tr>
<td>test_dbxml.tcl</td>
<td><p>Unit tests that check the procedures in dbxml.tcl directly.
   Loads the functions from dbxml.tcl in the ClientAPI directory and 
   attempts various operations to test the functions.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh test_dbxml.tcl</p>
   <p>The script attempts to perform the following actions:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Wraps a number of requests into XML using WrapDbRequest</li>
   <li>Unwraps a number of XML responses using UnwrapDbResponse</li>
   <li>Unwraps an XML  broadcast using UnwrapDbBroadcast</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Note that this script tests the functions directly without
   invoking the handler or the client API.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dbccp4i_test_client.tcl</td>
<td>A client application that tests various operations via the Tcl
    client API.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>broadcast_test_client.tcl</td>
<td>A client application that tests the broadcast messages sent by the
    handler in response to various operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dirlock_client.tcl</td>
<td><p>A client application that tests how dbccp4i handles a lock on the
   user's directories.def file when client attempts to register.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh dirlock_client.tcl</p>
   <p>If the test succeeds then the handler should deal correctly
   with the lock it encounters.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>rude_client.tcl</td>
<td><p>A client application that tests for handler failure on unexpected
    client disconnection.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh rude_client.tcl</p>
  <p>If the test succeeds then the handler should still be
   running correctly after the client disconnects.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test_directories_client.tcl</td>
<td><p>A client application that tests for the consistency between two
    different methods of acquiring data about projects and data dirs.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>MrBump Compatibility Tests</h3>

<p>These tests attempt to check used by the version of MrBUMP that
uses the handler with a custom directories.def.</p>

<table class="TestScripts">
<tr>
<td>dbccp4i_test_client.tcl -directories <em>directories_mr</em></td>
<td>Run the test client application using the custom directories.def
    for MrBUMP, rather than the default directories.def file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test_directories_mr.py</td>
<td>Simple client application that uses the custom directories.def file
    for MrBUMP via the Python client API.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Tests Using a Temporary Project</h3>

<p>These tests require that a pre-existing project be supplied as an
argument. Within the run_tests.tcl script, helper scripts
<tt>setup_test_project.tcl</tt> and <tt>teardown_test_project.tcl</tt>
are used to create a temporary project with a unique name that the
tests are subsequently run using.</p>

<table class="TestScripts">
<tr>
<td>bigrequest_client.tcl <em>project</em> -limit 10000</td>
<td><p>Operates in one of two modes. In the first (default) mode, it opens the
   specified project and then submits requests which are longer each time,
   until the handler fails to return consistent output, giving a rough
   estimate of the maximum size of the request that the  system is able to
   process through the Tcl client API.</p>
   <p>In the second mode the user specifies a maximum number of jobs that
   the system must process, and the script reports whether this number can
   be successfully processed.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh bigrequest_client.tcl <em>&lt;project_name&gt; [-limit
   &lt;n&gt; ] [ -adjust_timeout ]</em></p>
   <p>In the default mode, the script attempts to perform the following actions:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Open the project and acquire the id for the last job in that project</li>
   <li>Submit a GetDescription request asking for the descriptions for a list
    of jobs consisting of that job repeated one hundred times, and check
    that the number of descriptions returned is equal to the number of
    job ids.</li>
   <li>Increase the list of jobs by 100 and repeat until failure occurs.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The script reports the size (in terms of numbers of jobs) of the failing
   request.</p>
   <p>If <em>-limit</em> is specified then the script tries a single request with
   a list of <em>&lt;n&gt;</em> jobs, and reports whether or not this was
   successfully processed.</p>
   <p><b>Notes:</b></p>
   <p>This test is of limited use in ascertaining the maximum size of requests
   that the system can deal with.</p>
   <ul>
   <li>In either mode the maximum number of jobs is not a precise
       value, and may vary depending on the length of the data values
       associated with the job that is chosen for the test - essentially
       it is a ballpark indication only.</li>
   <li>The upper limit is also dependent on the timeout that is chosen for
       the client API; for large requests the default timeout of 5000ms
       is too short for the transaction to be completed. This can lead to
       discrepancies in the maximum number of jobs obtained using the two
       different modes.<br />
       Specifying the <em>-adjust_timeout</em> option attempts to adjust
       the timeout period to compensate.<br />
       It is possible that other factors such as machine load might also
       make a difference to the maximum request size observed.</li>
   </ul>
    <p>For reference: with the default timeout in the iterative mode, the
    maximum request size on one particular machine. is around 16300 jobs. In
    the same mode with the adjusted timeout option, the maximum request size
    obtained is significantly higher (41400 jobs).</p>
    <p>A value of "10000" is used in the wrapper script as a baseline
    limit.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ccp4icompat_client.tcl <em>project</em></td>
<td><p>Client application that attempts to simulate the situation when a second
   process (e.g. CCP4i) interfering with the project lock and database files
   while the handler is also accessing the project.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh ccp4icompat_client.tcl <em>&lt;project_name&gt;</em></p>
   <p>The script attempts to perform the following actions:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Open the database for the specified project</li>
   <li>Override the lock on the project database</li>
   <li>Update the modification time on the project database</li>
   </ul>
   <p>At each step the script attempts to get data from the project
   to verify that the behaviour is as expected.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>openclose_client.tcl <em>project</em></td>
<td><p>Client application that attempts to close unopened or previously closed
   projects, and to open projects that have already been opened.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh openclose_client.tcl <em>&lt;project_name&gt;</em></p>
   <p>The script attempts to perform the following actions:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Close the project before opening it</li>
   <li>Open the project, and then open it again</li>
   <li>Close the project, and then close it again</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The script reports the success or failure for each of these actions,
   which should all fail if the tests are successful.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>opendb_client.tcl <em>project</em></td>
<td><p>Client application that tests for dealing with existing lock on project
   database when client attempts to open it.</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh opendb_client.tcl <em>&lt;project_name&gt;</em></p>
   <p>If the test succeeds then the script should report the list
   of jobs found in the project.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>demanding_client.tcl <em>project</em></td>
<td><p>Client application that attempts to simulate the effect of a client that
   generates large numbers of new jobs and other changes to a project in a short
   space of time (for example, an automated script).</p>
   <p><b>Usage:</b> tclsh demanding_client.tcl <em>&lt;project_name&gt;</em>
   <em>&lt;task_name&gt;</em></p>
   <p>The script attempts to perform the following actions:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Open the database for the specified project</li>
   <li>Creates ten new jobs with the specified taskname and modifies the data
       associated with each</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The script can be edited to adjust the time interval between the
   creation of new jobs. Outside of the wrapper script, multiple instances of
   the script can be run simultaneously to test the effect of multiple
   demanding clients, e.g.:</p>
   <pre>
   #!/bin/sh -e
   #
   # Run many instances of the demanding client
   tclsh demanding_client.tcl JUNK fake1 &amp;
   tclsh demanding_client.tcl JUNK fake2 &amp;
   tclsh demanding_client.tcl JUNK fake3 &amp;
   tclsh demanding_client.tcl JUNK fake4 &amp;
   tclsh demanding_client.tcl JUNK fake5 &amp;
   tclsh demanding_client.tcl JUNK fake6 &amp;
   </pre>
   <p><b>Warning</b> this script is very messy - it will leave large numbers
   of "fake" jobs in the project that it is run in. Either use a temporary
   project, or else open the project in CCP4i and use the "Delete/Archive..."
   options to remove this jobs in bulk.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dbitems_client.tcl <em>project</em></td>
<td>Client application tests that the data items available from the handler
    matches the list expected from looking at the default database.def
    file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>test_addfiles.py <em>project</em> 1 <em>filename</em></td>
<td>Client application to simulate the addition of the same <em>filename</em>
    to a job multiple times.<p>
    <p>Usage:</p>
    <pre>
    % python test_addfiles.py &lt;project&gt; &lt;job_id&gt; &lt;filename&gt;
    </pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Other Test Scripts</h3>

<p>These are not true automated tests, as they do report success or failure
in a way that can be checked from the wrapper script.</p>
