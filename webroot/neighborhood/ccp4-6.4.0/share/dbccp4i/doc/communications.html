<h1>dbCCP4i: Communication Protocols</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document outlines the general principles for the communications
between the handler and the client applications.</p>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>The communications between the handler and the clients are via sockets
and are marked up in a form of pseudo-XML.</p>

<p>Communications from the client to the handler are <b>requests</b>;
communications from the handler to the client are either <b>responses</b>
to specific requests, or unsolicited <b>broadcasts</b> which do not
correspond to any specific request.</p>

<p>The following sections describe the markup for each type of
communication.</p>

<h2>General principles</h2>

<p>Each communication is wrapped in a tag that expresses the overall type
of communication (request, response or broadcast). The following
implementation details are generally applicable to all types of
communication:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Communications are newline delimited</b> This means that none of
the tags or data can cannot unescaped newline characters. Note that
although the examples below are shown with newlines between many of the
tags, this is for clarity of presentation only.</li>
<li><b>Data items may contain non-newline whitespace characters</b></li>
<li><b>The special characters "&lt;" and "&gt;" within data should be
escaped</b> "&lt;" should be translated to "&amp;lt;" and "&gt;" should be
translated to "&amp;gt;".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requests</h2>

<p>Requests are wrapped in the following markup:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_request&gt;
&lt;command&gt;DbRequest&lt;/command&gt;
&lt;argument&gt;arg1&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;argument&gt;arg2&lt;/argument&gt;
...
&lt;request_id&gt;id&lt;/request_id&gt;
&lt;/db_request&gt;
</pre>

<ul>
<li><em>DbRequest</em> is the name of a command recognised by the handler
    (see separate documentation on the handler API). There should only
    be one command per request.</li>
<li><em>arg1</em>, <em>arg2</em> etc are the values of the arguments that
    are appropriate to the specific command. There is no limit to the
    number of arguments that can be specified. The argument values can
    either be single values, or lists of values (see
    <a href="#lists">Markup of the argument and result content</a>).</li>
<li><em>id</em> is an arbitrary string that can optionally be
    specified by the client; if it is then it will be included in the
    response from the handler.</li>
</ul>

<p>Requests fall into one of two broad categories: either a <b>request for
data</b> or a <b>request for action</b>. An example of a request for data
is asking for the value of a particular database item; an example of a
request for action is asking to modify the value of a database item.</p>

<h2>Responses</h2>

<p>Responses to requests are wrapped in the following general markup:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_response&gt;
&lt;status&gt;Status&lt;/status&gt;
&lt;result&gt;result&lt;/result&gt;
&lt;response_id&gt;&lt;/response_id&gt;
&lt;/db_response&gt;
</pre>

<ul>
<li><em>Status</em> indicates whether the handler was able to fufill the
    request from the client; it can take one of two possible values:
    <ul>
    <li><b>OK</b>: indicates that the handler was able to fufill the
        request</li>
    <li><b>ERROR</b>: indicates that the handler was unable to fufill
        the request.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><em>result</em> is the result of the request returned by the handler.
    The result can either be a single value, or a list of values (see
    <a href="#lists">Markup of the argument and result content</a>).</li>
<li><em>id</em> is the identifying string supplied by the calling
    application with the original request.</li>
</ul>

<p>The content of the <em>result</em> depends on the type of request and
on the <em>status</em> returned by the handler:</p>

<table border=2>
<tr>
<th>Request type</th>
<th>Example request</th>
<th>Response status</th>
<th>Result content</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan=2>Action</td>
<td rowspan=2>DbOpen</td>
<td>OK</td>
<td>Message describing the outcome</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<!--placeholder for previous row-->
<!--placeholder for previous row-->
<td>ERROR</td>
<td>Message describing the error, with a suggestion for how to
    recover if appropriate</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan=2>Data</td>
<td rowspan=2>DbGetData</td>
<td>OK</td>
<td>The requested data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<!--placeholder for previous row-->
<!--placeholder for previous row-->
<td>ERROR</td>
<td>Message describing the error, with a suggestion for how to
    recover if appropriate</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a name="lists"></a>
<h3>Markup of the <em>argument</em> and <em>result</em> content</h3>

<p>Within the <em>arg</em> and <em>result</em> tags, the structure
of the content may be enforced by additional markup. The following
structures are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single value</li>
<li>List of values</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Single value</b> is appropriate when one item is being sent or
returned, for example:</p>

<table noborder cellspacing=20>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
&lt;db_request&gt;
&lt;command&gt;DbRequest&lt;/command&gt;
&lt;argument&gt;arg1&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;request_id&gt;id&lt;/request_id&gt;
&lt;/db_request&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<em>or</em>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
&lt;db_response&gt;
&lt;status&gt;Status&lt;/status&gt;
&lt;result&gt;result string&lt;/result&gt;
&lt;response_id&gt;&lt;/response_id&gt;
&lt;/db_response&gt;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Lists of values</b> are appropriate when a single argument of a
request consists of several discrete items, or when multiple items are
returned from a single request. Lists are used to provide a programming
language-independent description of the data being passed:</p>

<table noborder cellspacing=20>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
&lt;db_request&gt;
&lt;command&gt;DbRequest&lt;/command&gt;
&lt;argument&gt;
&lt;list&gt;
&lt;item&gt;item1&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item&gt;item2&lt;/item&gt;
...
&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/argument&gt;
&lt;request_id&gt;id&lt;/request_id&gt;
&lt;/db_request&gt;
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<em>or</em>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
&lt;db_response&gt;
&lt;status&gt;Status&lt;/status&gt;
&lt;result&gt;
&lt;list&gt;
&lt;item&gt;item1&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;item&gt;item2&lt;/item&gt;
...
&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/result&gt;
&lt;response_id&gt;&lt;/response_id&gt;
&lt;/db_response&gt;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>For responses, lists can also be nested within other lists:</p>

<pre>
&lt;list&gt;
&lt;item&gt;
&lt;list&gt;&lt;item&gt;item1&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;item2&lt;/item&gt; ...&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;
...
&lt;/list&gt;
</pre>

<p>There is no limit on the level of nesting within responses, so it is
possible to have lists inside lists inside lists and so on.</p>

<p>Note however that no nesting is currently permitted in the arguments
of requests.</p>

<h2>Broadcasts</h2>

<p>Unsolicited broadcast messages from the handler to the client are
wrapped in the following general markup:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_broadcast&gt;
&lt;message&gt;Message text&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;operation&gt;operation&lt;/operation&gt;
&lt;project&gt;projectname&lt;/project&gt;
&lt;jobid&gt;jobid&lt;/jobid&gt;
&lt;agent&gt;agent&lt;/agent&gt;
&lt;/db_broadcast&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that none of these items are considered compulsory and ordering
is arbitrary. The general meanings of each element are as follows:</p>

<table border=2>
<tr><th>Element</th>   <th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>message</td>   <td>A free-text message describing the broadcast,
                           which is intended to be human-readable e.g.
                           for debugging purposes. The message text can
                           change arbitrarily so it should not be used
                           as the basis to trigger client responses to
	                   the broadcast.</td></tr>
<tr><td>operation</td> <td>The name of the operation that triggered the
                           broadcast (see below for the list of possible
                           operation names that can appear here).</td></tr>
<tr><td>project</td>   <td>The name of the project that the operation
                           relates to. This can be blank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>jobid</td>     <td>The job number in the project that the operation
                           relates to. This can be blank.</td></tr>
<tr><td>agent</td>     <td>The name of the user agent that triggered the
                           broadcast.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Note that some requests which should trigger broadcasts currently do
not (specifically, many of those associated with modifying the SQLite
database components).</p>

<h2>Examples of requests, responses and broadcasts</h2>

<p>Example requests and matching responses:</p>

<p>Request for status of the handler:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_request&gt;&lt;command&gt;DbRequestStatus&lt;/command&gt;&lt;request_id&gt;0&lt;/request_id&gt;&lt;/db_request&gt;
</pre>

<p>Response:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_response&gt;&lt;status&gt;OK&lt;/status&gt;&lt;result&gt;Active&lt;/result&gt;&lt;response_id&gt;0&lt;/response_id&gt;&lt;/db_response&gt;
</pre>

<p>Request for user to register with the handler:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_request&gt;&lt;command&gt;DbRegister&lt;/command&gt;&lt;argument&gt;wy45&lt;/argument&gt;&lt;argument&gt;15376&lt;/argument&gt;&lt;argument&gt;False&lt;/argument&gt;&lt;request_id&gt;request#1&lt;/request_id&gt;&lt;/db_request&gt;
</pre>

<p>Response:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_response&gt;&lt;status&gt;OK&lt;/status&gt;&lt;result&gt;True&lt;/result&gt;&lt;response_id&gt;request#1&lt;/response_id&gt;&lt;/db_response&gt;
</pre>

<p>Example of a broadcast message:</p>

<pre>
&lt;db_broadcast&gt;&lt;message&gt;Update TEST 40&lt;/message&gt;&lt;project&gt;TEST&lt;/project&gt;&lt;jobid&gt;40&lt/jobid&gt;&lt;operation&gt;data
changed&lt;/operation&gt;&lt;agent&gt;MrBump&lt;/agent&gt;&lt;/db_broadcast&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Limitations and issues</h2>

<p>The following comments suggest future possibilities that are not
currently implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>The possible status values for responses should probably be expanded
to OK, FAILED and ERROR. FAILED would indicate where the handler rejected
the request (for example not opening a project because it is locked);
ERROR would indicate where the handler was unable to fufil the request
(for example in the instance of runtime error in the database code).
In the case of errors or failures the handler should return an error
code, which can be defined in the handler API documentation.</li>
</ul>
