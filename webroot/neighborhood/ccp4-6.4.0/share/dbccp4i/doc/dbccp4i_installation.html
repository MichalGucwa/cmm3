<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>dbCCP4i is a "database handler" system for interacting with CCP4i project
databases. It consists of the "dbccp4i" program plus a number of supporting
applications, principally a visualiser program called "dbviewer" for looking
at project history data.</p>

<p>dbccp4i is a small server application that is intended to run in background
and act as a single point of access to the database for external programs
(referred to as client applications).</p>

<p>A recent CCP4 Newsletter article gives an overview of the project aims as
well as describing the components and their relationships in more detail:

<a name="requirements"></a>
<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h4>Basic requirements</h4>

<p>dbCCP4i is written in Python and requires this to be installed on your
system. It has been developed using version 2.4 so this is the recommended
version (it is possible that it may work with older versions however this is
untested). If you don't already have a suitable version of Python then
one is available from the CCP4 website (see below) or directly from the
Python website: <a href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</a></p>

<p>dbCCP4i also requires that you have a recent version of the CCP4 suite
(version 6.0 or better is recommended) installed on your system, and that
the ccp4.setup file has been appropriately configured and sourced. The
CCP4 software suite can be obtained via the CCP4 download pages:
<a href="http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/download.php">www.ccp4.ac.uk/download.php</a></p>

<p>To run the Tcl "dbconsole" application and the "dbviewer" application
Tcl/Tk version 8.4 (or better) is also required. This is the recommended
version for running CCP4i so you may already have this installed on your
system; if not then you can get a suitable version from the CCP4 website
or directly from the Tcl Developer Exchange:
<a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">www.tcl.tk/</a></p>

<p>The "dbviewer" application also requires the Graphviz package. Recent
versions of Linux appear to come with Graphviz as one of the packages on
the installation discs, otherwise you can download and install the most
recent version from the Graphviz website:
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org">www.graphviz.org</a><br />
Version 2.2 or better is recommended. If you already have Graphviz
installed then you can check the version by running "dot -V" at
the command line.</p>

<h4>Additional optional requirements for the SQLite database</h4>

<p>dbCCP4i is designed to use the CCP4i project database "out of the box"
and so doesn't need any additional packages to do this.</p>

<p>However it also has the option to use an embedded SQLite database
backend. In order to enable this functionality the following additional
packages are required:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>SQLite libraries</b> can be obtained from
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">www.sqlite.org/index.html</a><br />
    At the time of writing version 3.3.2 or better are required.</li>
<li><b>Python-SQLite</b> provides a Python to the SQLite libraries and
    can be obtained from
    <a href="http://initd.org/tracker/pysqlite/wiki">initd.org/tracker/pysqlite/wiki</a>
    <br />
    At the time of writing version 2.1.3 is recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p>See also the <a href="SQLite_setup.html">installation notes</a> (under
development).</p>

<p>Note: the SQLite database is not required for the basic operation
of dbCCP4i with the CCP4i databases, and has not be significantly tested.</p>

<a name="linux_install"></a>
<h2>Installation and setup for Linux</h2>

<p>To install and set up dbCCP4i on a Linux system, the following steps
are required:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that you have the required packages installed, and that the
    CCP4 environment has been set up.</li>
<li>Unpack the "dbccp4i" directory.<br />
    There is no requirement for this to be in a particular place.</li>
<li>Copy the "dbccp4i.setup-dist" file (if your shell environment is
    C-shell) or "dbccp4i.setup-bash" (if it is Bash) in the "etc"
    subdirectory to"dbccp4i.setup".</li>
<li>Edit the setting of the DBCCP4I_MASTER environment variable in
    "dbccp4i.setup", to point to the directory that dbccp4i was unpacked
    into (i.e. not the the dbccp4i directory but the one above it)</li>
<li>Source the edited dbccp4i.setup file to set up the environment.</li>
</ol>

<p>dbCCP4i and its applications should then be ready to use. A simple
test is to run one of the "console" applications; there are also a number
of test scripts in the "test" subdirectory: see the
<a href="tests.html">tests.html</a> document.</p>

<a name="windows_install"></a>
<h2>Installation and setup for Windows</h2>

<p>To install and set up dbCCP4i on a Windows system, the following steps
are required:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that you have the required packages installed, and that the
    CCP4 environment has been set up.</li>
<li>Unpack the "dbccp4i" folder.<br />
    There is no requirement for this to be in a particular place.</li>
<li>Execute the "winbatch.py" Python script in the "etc" folder. You
    can do this by starting a command prompt (go to
    <em>Start/All Programs/Accessories/Command prompt</em>) and then
    moving to the "dbccp4i\etc" folder, then do "python winbatch.py
    -dbccp4i_top DBCCP4I_TOP", where DBCCP4I_TOP is the absolute path
     of the "dbccp4i" folder.<br />
    This will generate a set of batch files that allow you to run the
    various applications (dbccp4i, dbviewer and so on).</li>
</ol>

<p>dbCCP4i and its applications should then be ready to use. A simple
test is to run one of the "console" applications; there are also a number
of test scripts in the "test" subdirectory: see the
<a href="tests.html">tests.html</a> document.</p>

<a name="applications"></a>
<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>A number of applications are available:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>dbconsoles:</b> the dbconsole applications provide simple
    command-line access to dbCCP4i via the client API command libraries.
    There are two console applications, one in Tcl ("dbconsole") and one
    in Python ("dbconsole_py").</li>
<li><b>dbviewer:</b> the viewer offers a flow-diagram type view of
    the jobs in your CCP4i project. It can be started by typing
    "dbviewer" at the command line.</li>
<li><b>starKey:</b> an application that will generate an XML-formatted
    summary of the project history.</li>
</ul>

<p>Under Windows these can be run from the command prompt using the
batch files "dbconsole.bat", "dbconsole_py.bat", "dbviewer.bat" and
"starKey.bat", which should have been generated as part of the
installation process.</p>

<a name="directories"></a>
<h2>Directory Structure</h2>

<p>The following directories can be found in the installation:</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>application</b></dt>
<dd>Source code for the client applications (the consoles, viewer and
    starKey)</dd>
<dt><b>bin</b></dt>
<dd>UNIX shell script launchers for the handler and client

</dl>

<a name="ccp4i_compatibility"></a>
<h2>Compatibility with CCP4i</h2>

<p>Both CCP4i and dbCCP4i use the same system for accessing project and
job database formats and standards, so there should be no problem running
them interchangeably.</p>

<p>However: the current release version of CCP4i (1.4.4) doesn't use dbCCP4i
and does not have the facility to simultaneously share the database resources
with dbCCP4i at runtime. It does however have some simple fail-safe mechanisms
to try and prevent corruption of data in the user's project databases in the
event of "competition" between processes for those databases.</p>

<p>dbCCP4i for its part is intended to fail-safe when it detects
unexpected changes to the database resources while it is running, for
example if CCP4i is running at the same time.</p>

<p>Therefore it is likely that there may be some unexpected run-time
behaviour if CCP4i and dbCCP4i are running simultaneously, though this
should not result in damage to data the recommendation for this version
is to try and avoid running them simultaneously.</p>

<a name="known_issues"></a>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>dbCCP4i should now work under both Linux and Windows, however it has
not been extensively tested on the Windows platform (particularly the
SQLite backend).</p>
