This distribution contains the CCP4 database handler "dbccp4i" and
associated applications.

The handler provides access to the CCP4i job database for arbitrary
applications. Client API libraries are provided for this purpose.

Documentation can be found in the "doc" subdirectory. Start from the
file INDEX.html.

The file "dbccp4i_installation.html" (also in the doc subdirectory)
should be consulted for installation and basic usage information.

or other queries.
