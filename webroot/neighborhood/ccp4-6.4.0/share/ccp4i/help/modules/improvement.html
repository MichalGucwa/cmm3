<p>The layout of each task window, <em>i.e.</em> the number of folders present,
and whether these folders are open or closed by default, depends on the choices
made in the <strong>Protocol</strong> folder of the task (see
<a href="../general/intro.html#task_window_format" target="_self">Introduction</a>). Although
certain folders are closed by default, there are specific reasons why you should
or may want to look at them. These reasons are described in the Task Window
Layout sections below.</p>

<h4><a name="important_note"></a>Important Note on Density Modification</h4>

<!--<p>Beware that the final FOMs output by the Solomon process are very over-optimistic and
can not be used with any reliability in any later processing. It is totally unreasonable
to run '<tt>dm</tt>' after running Solomon - you could try both processes on the
same initial data but you can not run them in sequence.</p>-->

<p>Beware that the FOMs produced by density modification are generally
overestimated and should be treated with considerable care. For
example, '<tt>dm</tt>' will usually produce better results when given native
SHARP phases rather than SHARP+SOLOMON phases. The same caution
applies to using density modified phases in refinement, although this
may be achieved if only a few cycles of density modification are
applied and phase blurring is used in REFMAC.</p>

<h3><a name="matthews1"></a>Cell Content Analysis</h3>

<p>The program MATTHEWS_COEF, through the Cell Content Analysis task, can
provide an estimate of the solvent fraction, which is needed when performing
density modification. The solvent fraction calculation requires an
estimate of the molecular weight of the protein (which can be obtained from
the program 
<a href="../../../../html/rwcontents.html" target="_PROGDOC">RWCONTENTS</a>,
for example) and the number of molecules in the asymmetric unit.</p>

<h3><a name="professs1"></a>Find NCS from Heavy Atoms</h3>

<p>PROFESSS is a tool to help in the identification of NCS related atoms from a
list of heavy atom positions. NCS operators determined from PROFESSS can be
used to define the NCS averaging mask in `<tt>dm</tt>'.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="exptphase.html#professs">Professs - NCS from HA</a></p>

<h3><a name="getax"></a>Real Space Correlation Search - Getax</h3>

<p>GETAX is a program to search for non-crystallographic symmetry if an initial
map is available. The only knowledge required is a self rotation solution and a
crude knowledge of the size/shape of your molecule(s).</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/getax.html" target="_PROGDOC">GETAX</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="dm"></a>Run DM - density improvement</h3>

<p>DM is an automated procedure to apply real space constraints based on
known features of a protein electron density map in order to improve
the approximate phasing obtained from experimental sources. It
combines automatic solvent and NCS masking, solvent flattening,
averaging over multiple domains, and a range of other techniques.</p>

<p>The DM program documentation states:
&quot;Histogram matching is enabled by default. However there may exist some very
exceptional cases where histogram matching is undesirable. Such cases should
first be established by careful trials with synthetic data or solved structures.
Histogram matching is more often disabled through ignorance or superstition. It is
disabled by adding the NOHIST subkeyword.&quot;</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/dm.html" target="_PROGDOC">DM</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="solomon"></a>Run Solomon - density improvement</h3>

<p>Solomon takes as input a map and outputs an improved map. By default it is run
in solvent-flipping mode which corresponds to adding the inverted solvent density to
the initial map. This is similar to adding negative noise to an image in order to
strengthen the signal/noise ratio. The alternative solvent flattening mode will just
attempt to reduce solvent density to zero - this is not usually an advisable option.</p>

<p>The script will generate an initial map and requires the input of initial phases and
FOMs which would normally come from heavy atom refinement such as MLPHARE. The FOMs
are needed at a later stage, running SIGMAA, for recombination with newly calculated
phases.</p>

<p>By default, the CCP4i script runs for ten cycles of alternating Solomon with SFALL
which does a back transform of the map to give phases which are combined with
the input phases by SIGMAA. The new phases are then used to generate a
new map which is input into the next run of Solomon.</p>

<p>The resolution of the phases is usually extended by ~0.2-0.5&#197; during the
running of this process.</p>

<p>Ideally this process should be run using maps of just the asymmetric unit but due to
limitations with SIGMAA it may be necessary to use the entire unit cell and treat the
data as spacegroup P1. If there are still problems in running the script, it may be
necessary to specify the map grid which is an option in the <em>Infrequently Used
Options</em> folder.</p>

<p>The present CCP4i Solomon script does not incorporate handling of NCS.</p>

<h3><a name="dmmulti"></a>Run DmMulti - multi-crystal density modification</h3>

<p>DMMULTI is a package which applies real space constraints based on known
features of a protein electron density map in order to improve the approximate
phasing obtained from experimental sources. The program may be applied to data
from one or more crystal forms simultaneously.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/dmmulti.html" target="_PROGDOC"><tt>dm</tt>multi</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="pirate"></a>Pirate - statistical phase improvement</h3>

<p>PIRATE performs statistical phase improvement by classifying the
electron density map by sparseness/denseness and order/disorder, with
the aim of obtaining superior results to conventional solvent mask
based methods without requiring knowledge of the solvent content.</p>

<p>The target distributions are generated by a simulation calculation using
a known 'reference' structure for which calculated phases are available.
The success of the method is dependent on the features of the reference
structure matching those of the unsolved, 'work' structure. For the common
case of a protein of mostly equal atoms (i.e. not a metalloprotein), a
single reference structures can be used, with modifications automatically
applied to the reference structure to match its features to the work
structure.</p>

<p>Suitable reference structures can be constructed from the PDB using
<a href="makereference">Make Pirate Reference File</a>.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/cpirate.html" target="_PROGDOC">PIRATE</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="makereference"></a>Make Reference File for Pirate</h3>

<p>This interface can be used to generate a suitable reference file for
input into <a href="#pirate">Pirate</a>, given a coordinate file with
similar features as expected for the target structure.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/cpirate.html" target="_PROGDOC">PIRATE</a>.</p>

<a href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/pirate/pirate.html" target="_EXTERNAL">Kevin Cowtan's
'<tt>pirate</tt>' homepage</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="did_it_work"></a>Did It Work?</h3>

<p>The success of a density modification run should be judged by whether the final phases
produce a better (<em>i.e.</em> more interpretable) map as viewed on graphics. The masks
produced by '<tt>dm</tt>' can also be viewed by graphics.</p>

<h4><a name="maps"></a>Maps</h4>

<p>It is easiest to create maps by running the FFT task inside the desired Density
Improvement task. Do this by toggling on the option 'Create map file in ...' in the Protocol
folder. The format of these maps can then be chosen.</p>

<p>Maps may also be (re)created independently from the Density Improvement tasks,
through the <a href="maputils.html#task_maps" target="_self">Create Task-Specific Maps</a>
task in the Map &amp; Mask Utilities module. The only input this task requires is the job number
of the original job - all other parameters will be restored from the database.
This task will produce the appropriate maps, even when they were not
calculated in the original job.</p>
