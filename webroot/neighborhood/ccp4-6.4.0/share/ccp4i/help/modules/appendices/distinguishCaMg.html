<h4>Question</h4>

<!--From: Yong Xiong <yxiong@chemistry.ohio-state.edu>-->
<p>I am having troubles in identifying two metal ions in a structure.
I used Mg<sup>2+</sup> in sample preparation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in crystallization. The
concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a few folds higher than that of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The metal
ions have good octahedral geometry and both Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> could fit and be 
well refined. I am at almost the final stage of refinement with R/R-free
20.5/22.4 (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or 20.8/22.6 (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) for data between 10-2.2&#197;. Difference
density map doesn't resolve this ambiguity, <em>i.e.</em> both type of ions have
relatively clean maps. I am inclined to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> because the crystal only
grew in the presence of this ion. However, one of the metal sites doesn't
involve intermolecular interaction at all, so at least for this site it
should have nothing to do with crystallization.</p>

<p>I would like to know about the experts' opinions. The question in my mind is
whether the bonding distance with the coordinating oxygens is a
discriminator (&#126;2.3&#197; in my case)? Also how much the B-factor can tell? (in
my case, Mg<sup>2+</sup> &#126;12, Ca<sup>2+</sup> &#126;29, average of the molecule &#126;37).</p>

<p>You should be including the low resolution data if you have it (<em>i.e.</em>, 
20 - 30&#197;) and this will allow an accurate bulk solvent correction (this
is really just general advice).</p>

<p>&gt; Difference density map doesn't resolve this ambiguity, <em>i.e.</em> both type of ions have
relatively clean maps.</p>

<p>Because the change in B-factor is mopping up the difference. See

<p><a name="bfactormop"></a>You should check the B-factor of the protein atoms that are the
ligands. If the atoms have B-factors around 12, then the Mg<sup>2+</sup> appears
to be appropriate. If they are around 29, then the Ca<sup>2+</sup> is likely the
answer.</p>

<p>You could also use Eleanor Dodson's trick of looking at the anomalous
signal in your data (assuming you kept track of it coming out of
scalepack or whatever you used). Ca<sup>2+</sup> has a small but detectable
anomalous signal, and if the data are ok, should be visible in an
anomalous Fourier.</p>

<li><!-- From: Kostrewa, Dirk <DIRK.KOSTREWA@roche.com>-->
<p>There are a few things you can do to distinguish between Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>:
<dl>
<dt>Metal-Ligand Geometry</dt>
<dd><li>Mg<sup>2+</sup> should be always octahedrally coordinated and an average Mg<sup>2+</sup> to O
distance of 2.1&#197;.</dd>
<dd><li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> has preferably seven or eight ligand atoms with an average Ca<sup>2+</sup> to O
distance of 2.4&#197;.</dd>
<dd><li>Both metals are &quot;hard&quot; metals which like &quot;hard&quot; ligands, that is oxygen,
only (nitrogen is a very rare exception, sulfur shouldn't appear). There are
two excellent reviews about metals in proteins: Glusker, J. P. (1991)
Advances in Protein Chemistry, Vol. 42, 1-75, and Harding, M. M. (1999 )
Acta Crystallographica, Vol. D55, 1432-1443.</dd>
<dd><li>You have observed an octahedral ligand sphere (indicative for Mg<sup>2+</sup>) with an
average metal-to-ligand distance of 2.3&#197; (indicative for Ca<sup>2+</sup>). However, be
cautious! Your metal-ligand distances are the result after refinement
usually with geometrical restraints, in this case van der Waals radii. In
X-PLOR and CNS, the van der Waals radii of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are by far too
large resulting in too large metal-to-ligand distances (which could be an
explanation for  2.3&#197; for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-to-oxygen  distance)! I use sigma of 0.8552
for Mg<sup>2+</sup> which gives an energy minimum for Mg<sup>2+</sup>-to-O at 2.08&#197;, and 1.4254
for Ca<sup>2+</sup> which gives an energy minimum for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-to-O at 2.4&#197; (look at the
formula for the energy minimum, insert the value for oxygen and solve for
the &quot;best&quot; value for the metal). So, please, before you judge refined
metal-to-ligand distances, check the &quot;ideal&quot; geometry parameter of the
refinement program of your choice!</dd>
<dt>Crystallographically</dt>
<dd><li>Ca<sup>2+</sup> has 8 more electrons than Mg<sup>2+</sup> which should give you a much higher
electron density (contour at, say, &#126;4 rmsd(rho): do you see the well ordered
sulfurs and your metal, only?). But with this you can only identify Ca<sup>2+</sup> if
its occupancy is close to unity. If the occupancies are close to unity, a
falsely placed Mg<sup>2+</sup> instead of a real Ca<sup>2+</sup> would have a very low B-factor
and vice versa.</dd>
<dd><li>Do you still have the raw data? If yes, don't merge the Friedel pairs to
get any anomalous signal in the data. Calculate an anomalous difference
Fourier (CCP4 FFT): do you see the metal? Calcium has an f'' of 1.286
electrons at CuKa radiation, which is high enough, whereas magnesium has
only an f''=0.177, which is neglectable.</dd>
<dd><li>If you still have crystals, soak one with Mn<sup>2+</sup> instead of Mg<sup>2+</sup>: Mn<sup>2+</sup> is
a very good substitute for Mg<sup>2+</sup> but has 13 more electrons. If you calculate
an (Fo(Mn<sup>2+</sup>)-Fo(unknown)) electron density map, you should see a clear
signal if unknown=Mg<sup>2+</sup> and a weak signal (if any) if unknown=Ca<sup>2+</sup></dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li><!-- From: Ulrich Baumann <ulrich.baumann@ibc.unibe.ch>-->
<p>I 'd suggest Ca<sup>2+</sup> from your bond distances and B-factor (What B-factors do
the ligand atoms have?). Watch out for waters -- Ca<sup>2+</sup> is often sevenfold
coordinated while Mg<sup>2+</sup> only sixfold, although I have seen Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions
with an octahedral ligand sphere. At what wavelength did you collect your
data? CuKalpha would offer a unique possibility by calculating an
imaginary electron density map (coefficients (F+ - F-)exp[i(phimodel -
pi/2)]) which should show nice high peaks on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> (and the sulphur
atoms). I think the f'' component for Mg<sup>2+</sup> is too small to give a
detectable signal here, so this should discriminate the two alternatives. 
However, to do this you must have collected the Friedel pairs ....</p>
</li>

<li><!-- From: Eleanor J. Dodson <ccp4@ysbl.york.ac.uk>-->
<p>Even a little anomalous data will decide this question.<br />
If you run FFT with DANO=D_nat PHI=PHIC you should see very clear peaks
for a Ca and none for Mg.<br />
Everyone collects some anomalous data - but if you run SCALEPACK with
ANOM NO, you can lose it. If you always set ANOM YES, you still get a
merged &lt;I&gt; for all hkl and -h-k-l pairs but the output also preserves
the anomalous differences where observed. This is the default for
SCALA.</p>

<p>Looking at bond distances is rather risky; the refinement programs often
have &quot;hidden&quot; restraints which can distort your geometry. For instance
most programs apply a VDW repulsion unless you specifically request that
it be turned off.</p>

<li><!-- David E. Timm <dtimm@iupui.edu>-->
<p>We have recently put a lot of effort into identifying divalent cations
present in the active site of an enzyme that was not previously known to
utilize a metal cofactor. We had 150 mM Ni<sup>2+</sup> as a crystallization additive,
but the protein had also seen Ca<sup>2+</sup> during a thrombin digestion step.  The
active site actually ended up with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and a Mg<sup>2+</sup>,
with a single Ni<sup>2+</sup>
making a lattice contact. We were helped out by having several data sets
ranging from 1.25 to 1.9&#197;, compared to the 2.2&#197; data trying to distinguish
between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. I don't have anything to add beyond the previously
suggested use of anomalous data and a comparison of B-factors for the metal
ligands, rather than to the overall B. However, I was surprised that
difference maps weren't good indicators at 2.2&#197;. At 1.9&#197; we observed
respective peaks or troughs in the Fo-Fc maps when too light or too heavy a
cation was used in the model, even though the B-factors were soaking up a lot
of the error.</p>

<!--With regard to Eleanor's comments about VDW radii, what is the best way to
handle metal centers in REFMAC to assess coordination geometry based on
diffraction data rather than refinement restraints?  Is the suggestion to
just artificially set the metal VDW radius to near zero and see where the
surrounding ligands end up?  How is the VDWR altered in PROTIN for atom
types not defined by an ICODE number (VDWR <nvdw> <type_1> <icode_1>
<dvdw_1> ... ?  Only 10 ICODES are listed in the protin.doc.-->

<p>Finally, one contributor to the discussion stated that, &quot;Mg<sup>2+</sup> should be
always octahedrally coordinated and an average Mg<sup>2+</sup> to O distance of 2.1&#197;.
Ca<sup>2+</sup> has preferably seven or eight ligand atoms with an average Ca<sup>2+</sup> to O
distance of 2.4&#197;.&quot; It is dangerous to say &quot;always&quot; in any scientific
discussion. We have refined a 1.25&#197; structure containing a Ca<sup>2+</sup>
coordinated by six ligands and a Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinated by five ligands,
consistent with our ICP Atomic Emission Spectroscopy measurements. A search
of the database at
<a href="http://metallo.scripps.edu/current/raw.html">http://metallo.scripps.edu/current/raw.html</a>
turned up 43, 54 and 269 respective matches for Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinated respectively by 4, 5 or 6
ligands, while 102, 160, 369, 445 and 114 respective matches were made for
Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinated by 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 ligands. Clearly, there is considerable
variability in metal ion coordination geometries.</p>
