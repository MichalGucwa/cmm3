<h4>Question</h4>

<!--From: Shee Mei-->
<pre>
    I am trying to purify a histidine tag Lim-homeo domain
(transcription factor) through a NTA-Ni column. After I had purified the
protein, I will analyse it through the light scattering machine and also
gel filtration but I always get aggregates. I thought it could be due to
the presence of contaminating DNA or maybe some problems with the
buffer. I have modified the buffer to include DNase (to get rid of the
DNA), 0.2M NaCl, 10% glycerol and using Tris as a buffering system. I
had got very low DNA contamination this time but the protein still
aggregates. Does anyone have any experience in trying to solubilise
similar proteins?
</pre>

<h4>Summary of answers/suggestions</h4>

<p>Although this is not a problem of 'Crystallographic Computing', in this
form, the information could come in very handy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sometimes aggregation could be due to oxidation (in artificial
environment) of cysteine residues leading to formation of disulphide
bridges. Try using 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol to prevent oxidation.
<!--(Andrea Schmidt and David E. Timm)-->
</li>
<li>Use higher salt (0.5M) and glycerol to stabilise proteins.
<!--(Bente Vestergaard, Andrea Schmidt, David Timm, Haixin Sui)-->
</li>
<li>Monitor the pH and keep it away from the pK of the protein.
<!--(Haixin Sui and Bente Vestergaard)-->
</li>
<li>When his-tag protein is purified through Ni-NTA column, during
elution Ni often gets eluted along with the protein and binding of
proteins to the eluted Ni could be the cause of aggregates. Try
dialysing the protein against 10mM EDTA or just by addition of EDTA
to the tubes used to collect fractions.
<!--(David Lawson, David Timm, Yu Wai Chen, Allen Matte, Merak X. Zhang)-->
</li>
<li>Combat the problems of aggregation by using organic solvent <em>e.g.</em>
6% methanol or ethanol. It is also found that tritonX or ACN can dissolve the
aggregates. Using detergent screen from Hampton and then monitoring through
DLS could be a good way of screening.
<!--(Jeff Habel and labmates)-->
</li>
<li>Try and cut the His-tag off. It is observed that solubility of
His-tagged proteins can be influenced by the presence of the tag.
<!--(Yu Wai Chen, Allan Matte)-->
</li>
<li>Add the target DNA to the transcription factor; the source of aggregation
might be due to poorly folded protein.
<!--(Stephen Soisson)-->
</li>
<li>Use an alternative column for purification of His-tag protein: Cobalt-TALON.
Ions on the column will not detach because it has one more dental holding the ion.
<!--(Martin Laurberg)-->
</li>
<li>It is possible to still use EDTA (to get rid of the Ni) even if a protein is
a zinc binding protein. Try adding 1.5mM EDTA and 2mM zinc chloride.
<!--(Jeremy Beauchamp)--></li>
<li>Try using low pH to elute His-tag protein from the Ni-NTA column. It is also
noted that a longer His-tag reduces protein solubility and favours aggregation.
<!--(ALex Pautsch)-->
</li>
<li>It has been observed that b-mercaptoethanol can bind to the cysteine residues
and form a covalent adduct. Try using other alternatives <em>e.g.</em> DTT.
