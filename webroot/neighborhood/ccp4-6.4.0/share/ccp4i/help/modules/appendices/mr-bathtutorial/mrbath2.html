<h1>2. Molecular Replacement: Basic concepts</h1>

<p>Similar molecules can form crystals with the same or with very different packing arrangements
of the molecules within the unit cell. These differences arise even for molecules with identical
shapes because the packing is determined not only by shape but by intermolecular interactions
(charge, H-bond, hydrophobic effect) at the molecular surfaces. An additional complication
arises when several molecular species co-crystallise. In practice 4 cases can be distinguished;
in each case &quot;molecular complex&quot; may be substituted for &quot;molecule&quot;:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p>Similar molecules crystallise with essentially identical packing arrangements (<strong>isomorphism</strong>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The same or similar molecules crystallise with significant differences in their relative
positions (usually apparent from differences in the cell constants), while maintaining their
symmetry relationships (<em>i.e.</em> the crystals are <strong>non-isomorphous</strong>).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The same molecule forms two or more crystals with differing packing arrangements
(<strong>polymorphism</strong>), under the same or different crystallisation conditions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Similar molecules crystallise with different packing arrangements.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Knowledge of the molecular structure of one crystal can be used to derive the structure of the
same or similar molecule in another (&quot;<strong>target</strong>&quot;) crystal. If the crystals are isomorphous this can
be done by fitting the known molecule directly into the target crystal; otherwise the technique
of <strong>Molecular Replacement</strong> is used to conduct a search for the fit of the known molecule into
the target crystal by comparing their X-ray diffraction patterns.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.1" id="section2.1"></a>2.1. Prerequisites</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>
<p><strong>Observed amplitudes</strong> for the X-ray diffraction of the target crystal, but no
<strong>phases</strong> with which
to compute the <strong>electron density</strong>.</p>

<p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that the observed data is as <strong>complete</strong> as possible
within the high resolution
cutoff, <em>i.e.</em> minimal systematically missing regions (low resolution, cusp, zero layers <em>etc.</em>) and
detector overloads. There is considerable evidence that data incompleteness can have a
disastrous effect on the solution of the structure by Molecular Replacement, though there are
things that can be done to alleviate the effect.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Atomic coordinates</strong> for <strong>1 molecule</strong> of the homologous
<strong>model structure</strong>; for a protein at least
20% sequence similarity is usually needed, but the higher the better. Actually, what is really
needed is structural similarity, but of course this usually goes with sequence similarity.</p>

<p>The model should preferably be a crystal structure <strong>refined</strong> by structure factor least squares, and
with individual isotropic <strong>thermal parameters</strong>. Experience suggests that a lower degree of
structural similarity can be tolerated provided the model is an accurate crystal structure, though
it is not obvious why this should be so.</p>

<p>Don't forget to delete H<sub>2</sub>O and other solvent molecules from the model coordinates, and also
any obvious dissimilarities in the main-chain such as identified extra loops, but trimming
differing side-chains does not usually make much difference.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="section2.2" id="section2.2"></a>2.2. Symmetry</h3>

<p>Unless the <strong>space group</strong> happens to be <strong>P1</strong> (no rotational symmetry,
lattice repeats only), the
target crystal will contain several molecules in different orientations related by <strong>crystallographic</strong>
(or space group) <strong>symmetry</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> exact, and relating any pair of molecules anywhere in the
crystal. The space group is normally determined uniquely by the symmetry of the observed
<strong>diffraction pattern</strong> and from the <strong>systematic absences</strong> at the time that the raw
intensity data is
processed. However in some cases the systematic absences may not provide unique
information, and so there may be an ambiguity in the translation components of the space
group which can only be resolved by trial-and-error.</p>

<p>In addition, some crystals contain two or molecules (&quot;protomers&quot;) related by
<strong>non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS)</strong>, <em>i.e. </em>not exact and local, relating only specific pairs of
protomers within the same oligomer. This is usually apparent from a <strong>solvent-content</strong>
calculation, and also often, but not always, from pseudo-symmetry and/or lines of enhanced
intensity (&quot;spikes&quot;) in the observed diffraction pattern.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.3" id="section2.3"></a>2.3. The role of the Patterson function in Molecular Replacement</h3>

<p>A basic understanding of the workings of the Molecular Replacement (MR) method can be
gained by thinking about the <strong>Patterson functions</strong> of the model and target structures. It should
be understood however that in practice most MR programs do not actually work with the
Patterson functions directly, but do most of the work in reciprocal space with structure factors,
transforming into real space only at the end of the calculation. The detailed theory behind these
calculations is beyond the scope of these notes; numerous original papers and reviews on the
subject are available (see <a href="mrbath6.html" target="_self">section 6: Bibliography</a>).</p>

<p>From the observed amplitudes only (<em>i.e.</em> no
phases are used), we can calculate the
Patterson function of the target crystal; this
consists of peaks at positions corresponding to
the complete <strong>vector set</strong> of the crystal structure.</p>

<table class="bath1" align="center">
<tr>
<td>The target crystal will in many cases have a
different space group from the crystal of the
model structure, or may crystallise in the same
space group, but non-isomorphously, perhaps
due to large-scale relative motion of the
molecules in one crystal compared with the
other. Each independent molecule in the
asymmetric unit will therefore generally be in
a different <strong>orientation and position</strong>, usually
represented respectively by <strong>3 rotation angles</strong>
about the coordinate axes and by <strong>3 translation coordinates</strong>. This gives altogether 6N
parameters, where N is the number of molecules per asymmetric unit. Of course in the absence
of NCS there will be just 6 parameters because then N = 1.</td>

<p>If we knew all the 6N orientational and positional parameters, we could make a complete
model of the crystal from the model of one molecule, then calculate the structure factor amplitudes from the
coordinates and thermal parameters, and hence calculate a Patterson
function <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> derived solely from the model. This could be compared with the observed
Patterson function <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>; the simplest (though not necessarily the best!) way of doing this is with
the <strong>product function</strong>:</p>

<blockquote><em>S</em>(<strong><a
href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>) =
<a href="../chargifs/siu.gif"><font
face="symbol">S</font></a><sub>i</sub>
<em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>(<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>).<em>P</em><sub>calc</sub>(<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>)</blockquote>

<p>Here, <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> both vary with the vector
<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>. <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> also depends on the set of orientational
parameters
<strong><a href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong> and positional parameters
<strong><a href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>. The product function will
sum to a large value provided the peaks in <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> occur at the same position as the peaks
in <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub>.</p>

<p>An obvious approach to the problem of determining the unknown orientational and positional
parameters is simply to try all possible combinations of
<strong><a href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong> and
<strong><a href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>, and see which combination
gives the maximum value for the product function. For N = 1, this involves a search in 6
dimensions, and therefore the number of combinations to be tried goes up as the 6th power of
the number of trial values for each parameter. There must be enough trial values that the
separation between adjacent sample points is not so big that the maximum is missed
completely. Unfortunately, Patterson searches in 6 dimensions or higher are extremely
time-consuming and generally impractical. For N = 2, a 12 dimensional search would appear
to be required, and this is certainly out of the question. The strategy has to be to find ways to
decompose all these multi-dimensional searches into series of 3-D searches.</p>

<p>The vector set of the complete structure can be thought of as containing both <strong>intra-</strong>
and <strong>inter-molecular</strong> vectors. Although there is no way to distinguish these without knowing the
structure, and there is certainly never a clear-cut separation of the two types of vector, the
former tend to be shorter (nearer to the origin of the Patterson function); this simple fact is of
crucial practical importance.</p>

<p>The intra-molecular vector set depends only on the orientational parameters, and not on the
positional ones, whereas the inter-molecular vector set depends on both. It is possible to use
the differing length distributions to discriminate between intra- and inter-molecular vectors in
<em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> by including in the summation only those inside an envelope, usually spherical with a fixed
radius, centred on the Patterson origin. The aim is to choose this <strong>radius of integration</strong> to be
large enough that sufficient intra-molecular vector peaks are included, while not including too
many inter-molecular vector peaks. What in practice constitutes &quot;sufficient&quot; and &quot;too many&quot; is
discussed <a href="#section2.7">below</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.4"></a>2.4. The Rotation and Translation functions</h3>

<p>As an approximation therefore, the product function can be separated into two components: a
<strong>Rotation function</strong> (RF):
<em>R</em>(<strong><a href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>), and a
<strong>Translation function</strong> (TF):
<em>T</em>(<strong><a href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>,<strong><A
href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>), each now with 3N
variable parameters. Note that this Rotation function is also known as the <strong>cross-Rotation
function</strong> to distinguish it from the <strong>self-Rotation function</strong>, to be discussed
<a href="#section2.8">below</a>.</p>

<blockquote><em>R</em>(<strong><a
href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>) =
<a href="../chargifs/siu.gif"><font face="symbol">S</font></a><sub>i<a
href="../chargifs/in.gif"><font face="symbol">&#206;</font></a>intra</sub>
<em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>(<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>).<em>P</em><sub>calc</sub>(<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>)</blockquote>

<blockquote><em>T</em>(<strong><a
href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>) =
<a href="../chargifs/siu.gif"><font face="symbol">S</font></a><sub>i<a
href="../chargifs/in.gif"><font face="symbol">&#206;</font></a>inter</sub>
<em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>(<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>).<em>P</em><sub>calc</sub>(<strong>u</strong><sub>i</sub>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>,<strong><a
href="../chargifs/tab.gif"><font face="symbol">t</font></a></strong>)</blockquote>

<p>In the TF, <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> has to be modified so that it contains only the inter-molecular vectors; this is
done by putting <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> on the correct relative scale, and then
subtracting the intra-molecular component of <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> from <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>. The
orientational parameters <strong><a href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong> are assumed
to be kept fixed, at the optimum values determined by the RF, during the TF search.</p>

<p>The functions described above are the <strong>full-symmetry</strong> RF and TF, because <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> contains
contributions from all molecules related by space group symmetry (and by NCS if present); of
course <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> does as well, but that is unavoidable. The intra-molecular component of
<em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> is
simply the superposition of all the individual molecular Pattersons, which are related to each
other by the crystallographic and non-crystallographic <strong>point groups</strong> (<em>i.e.</em> the purely rotational
components of the symmetry elements).</p>

<p>In practice most MR programs do not compute the full-symmetry RF, mainly because of
computational complications, though it should give better results. Instead, an individual
molecule of the model is placed in a hypothetical crystal without rotational symmetry (<em>i.e.</em> in
space group P1), and amplitudes calculated from this are used. This should still produce
maxima in the product function wherever the set of peaks in the calculated molecular Patterson
coincides with a subset of the peaks in <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>, though false maxima may arise from accidental
superpositions with peaks belonging the other symmetry related subsets in <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>.</p>

<p>The inter-molecular vector set consists of contributions from all pairs of molecules, whether
related by space-group symmetry or by NCS. In contrast with the RF, the full-symmetry TF
above (also known as <em>T2</em>) is the one that is most often used in practice, at least by the newer
MR programs. Some older programs still use the <em>T1</em> function, which derives from using the
subset of inter-molecular vectors from only 1 pair of molecules, but this does not generally give
as good results as the full-symmetry <em>T2</em> function, because again false maxima may arise from
accidental superpositions with peaks belonging to the other inter-molecular vector subsets in
<em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.5"></a>2.5. The Eulerian angles</h3>

<p>The set of orientational parameters
<strong><a href="../chargifs/omb.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a></strong>
consists of 3 variables for each independent molecule. 
These 3 variables could be defined in a number of different ways, but they are usually defined
as <strong>Eulerian angles</strong>: either the Crowther convention
(<strong><a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a>,
<a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a>,
<a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a></strong>) which is used consistently
throughout the CCP4 and MERLOT program suites, or the Rossmann &amp; Blow convention
(<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>1</sub>,
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>2</sub>,
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>3</sub>), or the X-PLOR convention
(<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>1</sub>',
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>2</sub>',
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>3</sub>').</p>

<p>They are usually described as operating on the coordinates, in the order as written, about the
axes <strong>after</strong> rotation, <em>e.g.</em>
<a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a> about the <strong><em>z</em></strong> axis, then
<a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a> about the <strong>new <em>y</em></strong>, then
<a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a> about the <strong>new <em>z</em></strong> (note
that these axes are not necessarily the same as the crystallographic axes). However, it is
probably conceptually simpler to regard them as operating on the coordinates in reverse order
about the <strong>fixed</strong> axes, <em>i.e.</em>
<a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a> about the <strong><em>z</em></strong> axis, then
<a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a> about the <strong>old <em>y</em></strong>, then
<a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a> about the <strong>old <em>z</em></strong>. Both
of these descriptions correspond to the equation:</p>

<blockquote><strong>r<sub>new</sub></strong> =
<strong>R</strong><sub>z</sub>(<a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a>) .
<strong>R</strong><sub>y</sub>(<a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a>) .
<strong>R</strong><sub>z</sub>(<a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a>) .
<strong>r<sub>old</sub></strong></blockquote>

<p>Note that although the <a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a> rotation is written first,
this is read as meaning that the <a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a> rotation is
applied to the coordinate vector <strong>r<sub>old</sub></strong> first.</p>

<p>Beware that the <strong>X-PLOR</strong> program employs the transpose of the R&amp;B convention; this is
pertinent if you wish to compare the results of X-PLOR with other RF programs. The X-PLOR
Eulerian angles are related to the Crowther ones by:</p>

<blockquote><a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>1</sub>' =
270&#176; - <a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a>,

<a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a>,
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>3</sub>' =
90&#176; - <a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a></blockquote>

<p>In all cases the angles increase anticlockwise looking towards the origin from the positive end
of the axis.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.6"></a>2.6. Asymmetric unit of the Rotation function</h3>

<p>The asymmetric unit of the RF is 1/M of a complete revolution in
<a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a> or
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>1</sub> (R&amp;B) or
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>3</sub>'
(X-PLOR), where M is the order of the crystallographic symmetry axis parallel to <em>z</em> in the
orthogonalised frame of the target crystal. Unless the model structure has symmetry about its
<em>z</em> axis, the asymmetric unit is a complete revolution in
<a href="../chargifs/ga.gif"><font face="symbol">g</font></a> or
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>3</sub> or
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>1</sub>'.
In <a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a> or
<a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a><sub>2</sub> it is &#189; a
complete revolution, unless the target crystal has at least one 2-fold axis perpendicular to <em>z</em>,
when it is &#188;. The <strong>AMORE / ROTFUN</strong> program automatically detects symmetry in
<a href="../chargifs/al.gif"><font face="symbol">a</font></a>, but
needs to be given the asymmetric unit in
<a href="../chargifs/be.gif"><font face="symbol">b</font></a>.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.7"></a>2.7. The choice of radius of integration and model unit cell</h3>

<p>The choice of the radius of integration in the RF can be critical in determining success or failure
but there is no consensus on how to make the choice. Usually it is a matter of trial-and-error,
as it is with the other parameters, such as resolution cutoffs. The size of the P1 unit cell in
which the model is placed, which is obviously related to the radius, is not so critical.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that a spherical molecule of <strong>diameter</strong> <em>D</em> will give an intra-molecular vector set in
the Patterson bounded by a sphere of <strong>radius</strong> <em>D</em>, so nothing will be achieved by having the
radius of integration larger than <em>D</em>. However a radius as large as <em>D</em> will certainly span the
interstices between molecules and include many unwanted inter-molecular vectors in <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub>. Also
in no circumstances must the radius be as large as the smallest primitive cell dimension of the
target crystal, otherwise the resulting inclusion of the large Patterson origin peak will cause
problems.</p>

<p>David Blow (in the 1985 Molecular Replacement Daresbury Study Weekend Proceedings, p.5)
suggests a value for the radius &quot;for an approximately spherical molecule ... 75-80% of the
diameter&quot;. The most common choice seems to be about half the diameter, or for an ellipsoidal
molecule the geometric mean of the ellipsoid semi-axes, which is roughly half the average
diameter. However my experience is that this is too small; it only encloses 1/8 of all possible
intra-molecular vectors, producing excessive &quot;noise&quot; in the RF. My own preference is for a
hybrid of the above options, namely 75% of the <strong>minimum</strong> diameter. Having decided, the
choice of the size of the unit cell is relatively straightforward: it must be at least the size of the
box bounding the model <strong>plus</strong> the chosen radius in each direction; then all the inter-molecular
vectors in <em>P</em><sub>calc</sub> will necessarily be longer than the radius and will be excluded. However it must
not be over-sized otherwise too many structure factors may be calculated.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.8"></a>2.8. Extra complications from non-crystallographic symmetry: Rotation function</h3>

<p>Frequently no information on the nature of any non-crystallographic symmetry will be available
initially, though there may be indications from the diffraction pattern. Also in special cases
where a crystallographic and a non-crystallographic screw or rotation axis happen to be parallel,
the <strong>native Patterson</strong> function will have distinctive features, so it is always worth computing this
if NCS is suspected. In the presence of NCS the difficulties of solution are multiplied several-fold, and the best
advice is probably to find a different crystal form!</p>

<p>In principle, the point group of the NCS can be deduced from the self-rotation function,
obtained by rotating <em>P</em><sub>obs</sub> against itself. 2-fold NCS is by far the most common, so normally the
sections of the self-RF are plotted in terms of <strong>spherical polar angles</strong> (see next section); this
allows the information on all 2-fold axes (crystallographic as well as non-crystallographic) to
be viewed simultaneously. Similarly all 3-fold axes can be viewed together, and so on. NCS
point group 222 (3 mutually perpendicular 2-fold axes) is quite common, so one might look for
right angles between pairs of peaks on the 2-fold section of the self-RF. Angles can be
measured directly from the plot by using a <strong>stereographic net</strong>.</p>

<p>If the self-RF can be partially or completely interpreted, a <strong>locked Rotation function</strong> may give
the best results. This is simply a cross-RF using the partial or full NCS point group symmetry,
with some or all of the protomers in the correct orientation relative to each other.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the self-RF can be very difficult to interpret, and is often only used to confirm
the conclusions drawn from the cross-RF. Any pair of correctly interpreted peaks in the cross-RF arising from
molecules related by NCS should correspond to a peak in the self-RF; working
out the correspondence is a matter of simple matrix arithmetic (alternatively program <strong>RFCORR</strong>
in CCP4 can be used to search for the correspondences).</p>

<p>The main difficulty with the cross-RF in the presence of NCS arises when one lacks complete
information on the NCS point group, and consequently there is no option but to search for
individual protomers. The intra-molecular vector set is a superposition of the individual
molecular vector sets and cannot be separated into its components, so 3-D searches for the
orientations of each protomer have to be conducted in the presence of the intra-molecular vector
sets from the other protomers. The cross-RF is then likely to be very noisy and may be hard
to interpret.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.9"></a>2.9. Spherical polar angles and the stereographic projection</h3>

<p align="center"><a name="polar.gif" id="polar.gif"></a><img src="polartr.gif" /></p>

<p>The 3 orientational parameters normally used in
the self-RF differ from those in the cross-RF. 
Instead of 3 Eulerian rotations about the
coordinate axes, there is a <strong>single</strong> rotation
<a href="../chargifs/ka.gif"><font face="symbol">k</font></a> about
an axis whose direction is defined by the
spherical polar angles
(<a href="../chargifs/om.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a>,<a href="../chargifs/ph.gif"><font face="symbol">f</font></a>).
Note that <a href="../chargifs/om.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a> is
sometimes called <a href="../chargifs/th.gif"><font face="symbol">q</font></a>, and
<a href="../chargifs/ka.gif"><font face="symbol">k</font></a> is sometimes called
<a href="../chargifs/ch.gif"><font face="symbol">c</font></a>
in the programs.</p>

<p>The sections of constant <a href="../chargifs/ka.gif"><font face="symbol">k</font></a> in the self-RF are
normally plotted in <strong>stereographic projection</strong>. 
Here, the point <a href="../chargifs/om.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a> = 0&#176; at the north pole of an
imaginary globe projects onto the centre of the
circular plot; while points on the equator with <a href="../chargifs/om.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a>
= 90&#176; project onto the circumference. The
asymmetric unit of the self-RF is always
contained in one hemisphere, so points outside
the range <a href="../chargifs/om.gif"><font face="symbol">w</font></a> = 0-90&#176; need not be plotted. Points
with <a href="../chargifs/ph.gif"><font face="symbol">f</font></a> = 0&#176; project onto the +<em>x</em> axis (meridian) of
the plot and <a href="../chargifs/ph.gif"><font face="symbol">f</font></a> increases anti-clockwise.</p>

<p>A <a name="stnet.gif"><a href="stnet.gif">stereographic net</a></a> (produced by, for example, program
<strong>STNET</strong> in CCP4) is used to measure
angles between points on a stereographic projection plot. The net used must have exactly the
same diameter as the plot, otherwise the results will not be accurate. The angle must be
measured <strong>along</strong> any one of the great circles (projected lines of longitude connecting opposite
poles). The other set of lines (projected lines of latitude parallel to the equator) sub-divide the
great circles and are calibrated in degrees to allow the angle to be read off.</p>

<p>You should be able to find 2 sets of 3
peaks; the sets are related to each other by a crystallographic 2-fold axis, and each set
corresponds to the 3 NCS 2-fold axes in a 222 tetramer. Using the stereographic net, you
should therefore be able to measure 90&#176; angles between all pairs of peaks within the set of 3.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.10"></a>2.10. Non-crystallographic symmetry: Translation function</h3>

<p>Assuming that the RF can be correctly interpreted, the solution of the TF in the presence of NCS
is likely to prove an even tougher nut to crack. This is because there is likely to be no prior
information at all on the positioning of the protomers within the oligomer, except in very
special high symmetry cases such as virus structures.</p>

<p>The strictly full-symmetry TF (crystallographic + NCS) is therefore generally not feasible, so a
TF for each protomer independently has to be done first, ignoring the others and using only
crystallographic inter-molecular vectors. However this procedure tends to give high
background noise arising from interference from inter-molecular vector sets between the other
NCS-related pairs; in any case it does not usually produce a unique solution because most space
groups have alternative origins, and so there is no guarantee that each protomer will be defined
relative to the same origin.</p>

<p>Once one protomer (<em>e.g.</em> &quot;A&quot;) is located, then a TF for the next (&quot;B&quot;)
can be done, using inter-molecular vectors between all B's, plus those between all A's and all B's.
Then &quot;C&quot; can be
searched for, using all inter-molecular C-C, A-C and B-C vectors, and so on. This procedure
ensures that the origins are uniquely defined. Of course the labels are completely arbitrary, so
it doesn't matter in which order the protomers are searched for.</p>

<p>The <strong>TFFC</strong> program computes the NCS <em>T2</em> function by splitting it into 2 components: the
&quot;crystallographic&quot; TF which uses only inter-molecular vectors of the type A-A, and the
&quot;non-crystallographic&quot; (or &quot;partial&quot;) TF which uses only inter-molecular vectors of the type A-B. 
The <strong>AMORE / TRAFUN</strong> program is more convenient in that it combines these into one
operation. However the price of this is that much more memory is needed.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile noting that this procedure is exactly analogous to that for finding heavy atoms
in an isomorphous difference Patterson: for &quot;protomer positional coordinates&quot; read &quot;heavy-atom
site coordinates&quot;, for &quot;crystallographic TF&quot; read &quot;Harker vector&quot;, and for
&quot;non-crystallographic TF&quot; read &quot;cross vector&quot; - then the procedure is identical!</p>

<p>For example, in space group P2<sub>1</sub> with 2 asymmetric units (labelled &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;)
per unit cell, and
4 independent molecules (labelled &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) per asymmetric
unit, the intra- and inter-molecular vector sets can be characterised as follows:</p>

<p>S = Intra-molecular vector set used in RF and subtracted in TF.<br />
C = Inter-molecular vector set used in crystallographic TF.<br />
N = Inter-molecular vector set used in non-crystallographic TF.</p>

<p>Note that there are many more N vectors than C vectors, so the TF using NCS is likely to be
less noisy and more reliable.</p>

<h3><a name="section2.11"></a>2.11. Asymmetric unit of the Translation functions</h3>

<p>The crystallographic component of the TF has the following asymmetric unit, depending on the

<pre>Except:     Space group F222 is &#188; of one of x, y or z; &#189; of the other two.
                 Space group F23 is &#188; of one of x, y or z; all of the other two.</pre>

<p>The space group of the TF is called the <strong>Cheshire group</strong>; it represents the symmetry remaining
when the material contents of the crystal are hypothetically removed, leaving just the crystal
lattice and its symmetry elements; in other words, just the smile after the rest of the Cheshire cat
has disappeared! (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, alias Lewis Carroll, was of course born in a
certain village in the county of Cheshire well-known to crystallographers, namely Daresbury.)</p>

<p>The non-crystallographic TF has the following asymmetric unit, depending on the lattice type:</p>

<table class="bath4">
<tr>
<th>lattice type</th><th>asymmetric unit</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P</td>
<td>All x, y and z.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>R</td>
<td>All x, y and z (3 asymmetric units).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>&#189; of x, all y and z (or &#189; of y, all x and z).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td>&#189; of one of x, y or z; all of the other two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>&#189; of x, y and z.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The correct asymmetric unit of the TF is automatically selected by <strong>AMORE / TRAFUN</strong>, but
with <strong>TFFC</strong> the appropriate <strong>LIMITS</strong> should be specified in <strong>FFT</strong>;
note that it doesn't matter if
the chosen asymmetric unit is too big; the peak list will just contain solutions translated by the
allowed origin shifts of the space group.</p>
