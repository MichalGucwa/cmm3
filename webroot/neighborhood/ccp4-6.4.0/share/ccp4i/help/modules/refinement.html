<p>The layout of each task window, <em>i.e.</em> the number of folders present,
and whether these folders are open or closed by default, depends on the choices
made in the <strong>Protocol</strong> folder of the task (see
<a href="../general/intro.html#task_window_format" target="_self">Introduction</a>).
Although certain folders are closed by default, there are specific reasons why you
should or may want to look at them. These reasons are described in the Task Window
Layout sections below.</p>

<h3><a name="overview"></a>Module Overview</h3>

<p>Refinement in CCP4 is usually done using the program 
<a href="../../../../html/refmac5.html" target="_PROGDOC">Refmac5</a>,
although there is also 
<a href="../../../../html/restrain.html" target="_PROGDOC">Restrain</a>
available. Before proceeding with refinement, it is important to check 
that there are suitable restraints in place. This should be the case for the
protein and common ligands, but needs to be checked for unusual ligands
and protein linkages (<em>e.g.</em> disulphide bonds). Therefore, the first step
should be to run Refmac5 in Review Mode (select <tt>review restraints</tt> in the
protocol section of the <strong>Run Refmac5</strong> task). Certain restraints 
will be placed in the PDB file, and these can be checked and changed if
necessary via the <strong>Edit Restraints in PDB File</strong> task. Restraint
dictionaries for ligands can be generated and/or edited using the
<strong>Monomer Library Sketcher</strong>. Multiple dictionary files can
be merged with the <strong>Merge monomer libraries</strong> task.</p>

<p>Refinement of the model can then proceed via the <strong>Run Refmac5</strong> 
task, as described <a href="#refmac" target="_self">below</a>. The special case of
<a href="#ncsref" target="_self"><strong>NCS Phased Refinement</strong></a> is treated in 
a separate task. For TLS refinement, an input file is required to
define the TLS groups, and this can be generated in the 
<strong>Create/Edit TLS File</strong> task.</p>

<p>After refinement, a number of analyses and checks can be performed.
The <strong>Tidy Waters</strong> task rationalises water molecules
according to the protein chain with which they are most likely associated.
The <strong>Analyse anisotropic U parameters</strong> task provides
analyses of U's obtained from a full anisotropic refinement, while the
<strong>Analyse TLS parameters</strong> task provides analyses of parameters
from a TLS refinement. Finally, the <strong>Run Sfcheck &amp; Procheck</strong> 
task must be run to validate the model structure.</p>

<h3><a name="restraints"></a>Overview of Restraints Handling</h3>

<p>Using Refmac for 'restrained refinement', 'structure idealisation' and
'TLS &amp; restrained refinement', requires restraints to idealised geometry
and these are also set up within Refmac. The options for 'unrestrained refinement' and 'rigid body
refinement' do not require restraints. Although restraints can be generated automatically,
the user is very strongly recommended on the first run of Refmac to check these restraints,
particularly for any ligand. There is an option to 'review restraints' which will perform
the restraint generation but no refinement.</p>

<p>Refmac restraint generation will attempt to find a match in the
geometry library for all residue types in the input PDB file; this will handle all standard
amino acids and nucleic acids and their link regions automatically.
The <strong>Review Restraints</strong> folder in the Refmac window controls the setting
up of restraints.
The user should be careful with the library descriptions of ligand molecules and wary that
the names of monomers in the geometry library and the atom naming conventions may not
be the same as in their structure. You can view the monomer in the geometry library using
the <strong>Monomer Library Sketcher</strong> and the option under the <strong>File</strong>
pull-down menu
to <strong>Read File</strong> -&gt; <strong>Load Monomer from Library</strong>. If you
have an unusual ligand you can use the <strong>Monomer Library Sketcher</strong> to
create a geometry library description from either an input PDB coordinate file or from a
structure that you sketch. If you generate your own geometry library, it must be given
as one of the input files to Refmac.</p>

<p>Refmac also needs additional restraints to define disulphide bonds, cis-peptides,
inter-residue links and any modified residues.
These are input to Refmac as the SSBOND, CISPEP, LINK
and MODRES cards in the PDB file. They are also generated automatically and written to
the PDB file when Refmac is run in 'review restraints' mode. The automatic restraint
generation is very dependent on the quality of the input coordinates; the results should
be reviewed and edited in the <strong>Edit Restraints in PDB File</strong> task. Note that
the format used by Refmac for the MODRES and LINK lines is slightly non-standard: there
is an option in the <strong>Edit Restraints in PDB File</strong> task to write the output
PDB file in standard format.</p>

<p>If there is non-crystallographic symmetry within the structure and you wish to restrain
the related chains to be similar (as is recommended in early cycles of refinement) then use
the <strong>Non-crystallographic symmetry</strong> folder in the Refmac window.</p>

<p>There is a 
<a href="../../../examples/tutorial/html/refine-tutorial.html" target="_TUTORIALS">
tutorial</a> introducing restraint handling. For an
introduction to this tutorial (and a route to the data to be used), see
<a href="../../../examples/tutorial/html/index.html" target="_TUTORIALS">CCP4 
Tutorial: Contents</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="coordconv"></a>Convert Coordinate Formats</h3>

<p>The program COORDCONV is used to convert coordinate files from various formats
(including SHELX, CSD and XPLOR-style formats) to PDB, CCP4 and XPLOR formats. The new
CCP4 Heavy Atom format is included, too. Take care in using the correct orthogonalisation
code.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/coordconv.html" target="_PROGDOC">COORDCONV</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="pdbset"></a>Edit PDB Model File - Pdbset</h3>

<p>The task runs with a choice of PDBCUR or PDBSET as the underlying program,
and can be used to perform various manipulations on coordinate files.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/pdbset.html" target="_PROGDOC">PDBSET</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/pdbcur.html" target="_PROGDOC">PDBCUR</a></p>

<h3><a name="edit_tls"></a>Create/Edit TLS File</h3>

<p>TLS refinement requires a definition of the TLS groups to be used, and
outputs the TLS parameters found for each group. This information is held
in special TLSIN / TLSOUT files. These files are simple ASCII files which
can be hand-edited, but they can also be created and edited with
the Create/Edit TLS File task.</p>
<p>You should first specify whether you are creating a TLS file from scratch,
or editing an existing TLS file. The task can also extract TLS parameters from
the REMARK 3 records of a PDB format file. This is less reliable than using a TLSIN
file, but may be the only option for structures obtained from the PDB. You
also need to specify whether to edit only the group definitions (as at the
start of TLS refinement) or whether you want to include TLS parameters for
each defined group.</p>
<p>You should then add or change the values in the <em>TLS group definitions</em> 
folder. You can have one or more groups, and each group can consist of one or 
more atom ranges. If TLS parameters are included for each group, these
are displayed, but obviously it is not a good idea to edit them!</p>

<h3><a name="refmac5_review"></a>Refmac5 Review Restraints</h3>

<p>The first step in refining a model should be to run Refmac5 in Review Mode,
which can be done via this interface. Certain restraints will be placed in the
PDB file, and these can be checked and changed if necessary via the
<strong>Edit Restraints in PDB File</strong> task. Restraint dictionaries for
ligands can be generated and/or edited using the <strong>Monomer Library
Sketcher</strong>. Multiple dictionary files can be merged with the
<strong>Merge monomer libraries</strong> task.</p>

<h3><a name="pdb_restraints"></a>Edit Restraints in PDB File</h3>

<p>This task will simplify editing the restraint records (MODRES, SSBOND,
LINK and CISPEP) in the PDB file. Refmac will use these restraints
specified in the PDB file dependent on the input commands from the <i>Setup
Restraints</i> folder in the Refmac task interface. You will normally
enter the name of an input PDB file (though this is not essential)
and by default the changed records will be written out to the same file
- but you can give an alternative output file name.</p>

<p>The first folder provides some information to help you with the rest
of the task. When the spacegroup is entered, the symmetry operations
for that spacegroup are listed. The residue modifications
and links currently defined in the geometry libraries are also listed.</p>

<h4><a name="edit_pdb_modres"></a>MODRES - Modified Residues</h4>

<p>By default the name of a residue in the PDB file should correspond
to the name of a monomer in the geometry libraries and the restraints defined
for that monomer will be used when refining the residue. The MODRES
records can be used to handle two types of non-default cases:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Modified residues</dt>
<dd>If there has been a small chemical change to
a standard residue then a MODRES record will define that change.
You should identify the modified residue (enter residue name, sequence
number, chain ID and insertion code) and the <i>LibNam</i> (<em>i.e.</em> the name
of the modification in the library).</dd>

<dt>Renaming residues</dt>
<dd>This is a means of aliasing the residue name
from the PDB file to a different monomer name in the libraries.
This may be necessary because the PDB file format does not allow residue
names greater than three characters but the geometry library names may
be up to six characters. To use the MODRES record in renaming
mode: enter the PDB file residue name, sequence number, chain
ID and insertion code; click on the button in the <i>Rename</i> column and
enter the <i>LibNam</i>, the name of the monomer in the library file.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note: CCP4 uses an extension to the MODRES record in the PDB file,
the LibNam field is increased from 3 to 6 characters (extending into the
field usually reserved for comments) and an extra 'mode' field is added
to the end of the record. When using the MODRES record in rename
mode the mode field is either RENAME or left blank. When
MODRES is used to modify a residue the mode field contains the
name of the modification (as taken from the geometry libraries) and the
LibNam field is left blank.</p>

<h4><a name="edit_pdb_ssbond"></a>SSBOND - Disulphide Bonds</h4>

<p>Refmac will usually do a good job of finding close cysteine residues and
automatically generating the restraints to maintain a disulphide bond but
you may need to enter definitions for difficult cases. Normally the
residue name sequence number, chain ID and insertion code should be entered
for both residues in the disulphide bond.</p>

<p>There are two cases which can complicate matters:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Alternative conformations</dt>
<dd>It is possible for cysteine
residues to adopt two or more alternative conformations and not all the
conformations will have the same disulphide bonding. The PDB format
does not allow for definition of alternative conformers in the SSBOND record
and the LINK record must be used instead with the link ID set to 'SS'</dd>

<dt>Symmetry Operators</dt>
<dd>Disulphide bonds can be between residues in
different asymmetric units of the crystal. It is not usually
necessary for the user to specify the symmetry relation between the two linked
units since the program can usually deduce them by testing
inter-atomic distances to all possible neighbouring molecules in the crystal.
All you need to do for disulphide bonds which are not within the same asymmetric
unit is click on the button in the column labelled 'Find Symm'.
Then the symmetry operations '1555' and '2555' will be written to the PDB
file and this will prompt Refmac to check for links bonds to neighbouring
asymmetric units (the PDB conventions for defining symmetry
operations are defined in the documentation for REMARK 290 of the
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/part_31.html"
target="_EXTERNAL">PDB guide for remarks 4-999</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<h4><a name="edit_pdb_link"></a>LINK - Inter-Residue Bonds</h4>

<p>The LINK record is a means of defining any non-standard bond or interaction
between residues. The standard links between consecutive peptides,
nucleic acids and sugar residues are deduced automatically by the program
from the coordinates and it is not necessary to enter them unless the coordinates
are poor or the link is non-standard.</p>

<p>To define a link you must enter the atom name, alternate indicator,
the residue name, sequence number, chain ID and insertion code for
two atoms. The link ID is a CCP4 specific field on the end of the
LINK record which should contain the name of a type of link defined in
the CCP4 geometry libraries.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Symmetry Operators</dt>
<dd>Links can be between residues in different
asymmetric units of the unit cell. It is not usually necessary
for the user to specify the symmetry relation between the two linked units
since the program can usually deduce them by testing inter-atomic
distances to all possible neighbouring molecules in the crystal.
All you need to do for links which are not within the same asymmetric unit
is click on the button in the column labelled 'Find Symm'. Then the
symmetry operations '1555' and '2555' will be written to the PDB file and
this will prompt Refmac to check for links bonds to neighbouring asymmetric
units (the PDB conventions for defining symmetry operations
are defined
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/part_31.html"
target="_EXTERNAL">as before</a>).</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note: CCP4 uses an extension to the PDB definition of a LINK record;
there is an extra <i>ID</i> field at the end of the record.</p>

<h4><a name="edit_pdb_cispep"></a>CISPEP - Cis Peptides</h4>

<p>To restrain a bond to a cis-peptide linkage you must enter the residue
name, sequence number, chain ID and insertion code for the two consecutive
residues connected by the cis-peptide bond. Note that using
this record is equivalent, within Refmac, to defining a link of type CIS or
PCIS between the two residues.</p>

<p>Note: The standard PDB definition of the CISPEP record includes
two fields, the model number and the angle, which are not used in Refmac
and are not in the interface.</p>

<h3><a name="sketch"></a>Monomer library sketcher</h3>

<p>See separate documentation:
<a href="sketcher.html" target="_self">Sketcher</a></p>

<h3><a name="merge_monomers"></a>Merge monomer libraries</h3>

<p>This task allows the user to combine geometry descriptions held in multiple
.cif files, into a single library file. The purpose is simply to enable all of a
user's geometry descriptions to be held in one library file.</p>

<h3><a name="refmac5"></a>Run Refmac5</h3>

<p>The <strong>Protocol</strong> folder in Refmac requires the user to choose the
type of refinement (default 'restrained') and the type of phase information to be
used (default 'none'). For certain types of refinement, TLS parameters
can be input as a fixed contribution to structure factors. Maps can be
generated in various formats and
the extent of map coverage (including the border) may be chosen here.</p>

<p>Depending on the selected Protocol option, the <strong>Files</strong> folder requires input
of various files (MTZ, PDB, TLS, library files), and names for the output files will be suggested.
If map files are to be generated (through the toggle button in the Protocol folder) <em>and</em>
the <a href="../general/preferences.html#creating_maps_refmac5" target="_self">Preferences</a> are set
such that output map files may be chosen explicitly, the Files folder will contain lines
for 'Fwt map' and 'DelFwt map'. Default filenames will be suggested, but they may be
changed.</p>

<p>Dependent on the selected Protocol option, other important choices can be made
in the <strong>Required Parameters</strong> folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>The method to be used for the calculation of the
crystallographic residual (maximum likelihood or least-squares).</li>
<li>The number of refinement cycles to be run.</li>
<li>In/Exclusion of hydrogens from structure factor calculation.</li>
<li>The resolution range of the data to be used in this refinement run.</li>
<li>The type of weighting (matrix/gradient) and the relative weights of the
X-ray and geometry terms, and the in/exclusion of experimental sigmas in
this weighting. The gold-coloured 'Message line help' at the top of the window
indicates the direction of change (increase or decrease) for tightening the
geometry.</li>
<li>The type of temperature factor refinement.</li>
<li>The handling of the 'free' reflections. Note that the MTZ label of the
free R column is set here, rather than in the Files folder - you should
make sure this is set correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="refmac_data_harvesting"></a>Refmac - Data Harvesting</h4>

<p>Refmac is one of the <a href="../../../../html/harvesting.html" target="_PROGDOC">Data Harvesting</a>
programs. See <a href="../general/harvesting.html" target="_self">Data Harvesting in CCP4i</a>
for implications for the Interface.</p>

<h4><a name="refmac_maps"></a>Refmac - Maps</h4>

<p>Refmac calculates special weighted differences to be used as coefficients for
electron density maps. It is easiest to create those maps by running the FFT
task inside the Refmac task. Do this by toggling on the option 'Generate weighted
difference maps files ...' in the <strong>Protocol</strong> folder. The format
of these maps can then be chosen.</p>

<p>The Refmac map coefficients FWT and DELFWT should be treated as 'composite
single Fourier coefficients'. Therefore, even though their appearance suggests
their use for difference (nF1-mF2) maps, Refmac coefficients should be used in
the calculation of a 'simple' map if the map is calculated independently from
the Refmac task with the <a href="maputils.html#fft" target="_self">Run FFT -
Create Map</a> task in the Map &amp; Mask Utilities module.</p>

<p>Maps may also be (re)created independently from the Refmac task, through
the <a href="maputils.html#task_maps" target="_self">Create Task-Specific Maps</a>
task in the Map &amp; Mask Utilities module. The only input this task requires
is the job number of the original job - all other parameters will be restored
from the database. This task will produce the appropriate maps, even when
they were not calculated in the original job.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/refmac5.html" target="_PROGDOC">Refmac5</a> or

<h3><a name="ncsref"></a>NCS Phased Refinement</h3>

<p>NCS Phased Refinement is expected to be very useful in the early stages of refining
molecular replacement solutions when the structure contains NCS models. The method works
by using the phases derived by '<tt>dm</tt>' from the NCS and solvent flattening and histogram
matching as input phases to Refmac.<!--  (GARIB - some proper explanation here please!)--></p>

<h4><a name="ncsref_input"></a>Input</h4>

<p>The task requires you to input:</p>
<ul>
<li>a model which contains all of the chains in the asymmetric
unit. CCP4i will automatically extract the names and residue ranges of
the chains to define the NCS Units and list them in the task
window.</li>
<li>a MTZ file containing the experimental Fs and a FreeR flag. You can also, optionally,
input experimental phases.</li>
<li>an estimate of the solvent content; the
<a href="coord_utils.html#matthews" target="_self">Cell Content Analysis</a> task in the

<h4><a name="ncsref_methodology"></a>Methodology</h4>

<p>If the user has not input experimental phases, the task runs Refmac for one cycle to
generate phases for input to '<tt>dm</tt>'. The task normally runs for two cycles and on
each cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>runs Pdbset to split the coordinate file to enable:</li>
<li>running Lsqkab to determine the translation and rotation between the NCS elements</li>
<li>runs '<tt>dm</tt>' to do solvent flattening, histogram matching and NCS averaging,
inputting the calculated translation and rotation</li>
<li>runs Refmac with input phases taken from '<tt>dm</tt>' for 5 cycles</li>
<li>runs Refmac for one cycle without input phases but with the refined structure to
generate unbiased phases</li>
</ol>

<p>After the refinement cycles, steps 1-3 are repeated so '<tt>dm</tt>' produces averaged
phases. Three maps are generated automatically: the averaged map and the weighted difference
maps based on phases from Refmac.</p>

<h4><a name="ncsref_maps"></a>Maps</h4>

<p>It is easiest to create maps by running the FFT task inside the NCS Phased
Refinement task. The option to 'Generate weighted difference maps files in ...'
in this task is toggled on by default. The format of these maps can then
be chosen.</p>

<p>Maps may also be (re)created independently from the NCS Phased Refinement
task, through the <a href="maputils.html#task_maps" target="_self">Create Task-Specific
Maps</a> task in the Map &amp; Mask Utilities module. The only input this task requires is the
job number of the original job - all other parameters will be restored
from the database. This task will produce the appropriate maps, even
when they were not calculated in the original job.</p>

<p>In some cases it may be necessary to create maps through the
<a href="maputils.html#fft" target="_self">Run FFT - Create Map</a> task in the
Map &amp; Mask Utilities module. Extreme care needs to be taken in the choice
of map type and coefficients. See <a href="#refmac_maps" target="_self">above
for Refmac Maps</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="watertidy"></a>Add/Tidy Waters - Watertidy</h3>

<p>This task rationalises waters at the end of refinement.</p>

<h3><a name="tlsanl"></a>Analyse TLS parameters</h3>

<p>This task provides various analyses of TLS parameters, such
as might have been obtained from a TLS refinement in Refmac.
It will also generate anisotropic U parameters from the input TLS
parameters and include them in the XYZOUT file, which can then 
be visualised in an appropriate graphics program (such as CCP4mg or Coot). 
It is important to remember that the U values have been derived from 
TLS rather than being refined independently.</p>

<p>By default, the derived anisotropic U parameters and the B factors 
contained on the ATOM lines include both the contribution
from the TLS parameters and the contribution of the input residual
B factors. Using the pull-down menu in the protocol folder, one
or other of these contributions can be selected on its own.</p>

<p>The task also has an option to output a file containing the TLS axes
in a format suitable for display in Molscript or in mmCIF format. The
latter can be imported into the CCP4 Molecular Graphics package for
display. </p>

<p>Finally, the folder <em>Other options</em> contains an option
for a detailed analysis of derived U values. This is useful if 
you have MAKE_U_POSITIVE warnings in Refmac5 - this will tell you 
which atoms are generating these warnings.</p>

<a href="../../../../html/tlsanl.html" target="_PROGDOC">Tlsanl</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="anisoanl"></a>Analyse anisotropic U parameters</h3>

<p>This task provides various analyses of anisotropic U parameters, held
in ANISOU records of a PDB file, such as might have been obtained from a 
full anisotropic refinement.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/anisoanl.html" target="_PROGDOC">Anisoanl</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="check"></a>Validate model and/or data - SFCHECK &amp; PROCHECK</h3>

<p>The program PROCHECK analyses the geometry of a structure and SFCHECK
analyses the goodness of fit between structure and experimental data.
Both programs are useful for identifying badly refined regions of a protein.</p>

<p>Both programs output their analyses in the form of postscript files. From SFCHECK
there is one file, but from PROCHECK there are, by default, ten postscript files.
After you have run the task, you can use the option to <tt>View Files from Job</tt>
(from the Database Menu on the right hand side of the Main Window) and select an
output file to display. The file will be displayed using the postscript display
program that is defined in your local CCP4i configuration (see
<a href="../general/configure.html#postscript_viewers" target="_PROGRAMMERSDOCS">Postscript Viewers</a>).
Also, when running PROCHECK, there is an option to print the output files automatically.</p>

<h4><a name="check_note"></a>Note on Running PROCHECK within CCP4i</h4>

<p>When PROCHECK is run through CCP4i, the script runs in the directory
$CCP4_SCR so additional output files can be found there. There is a file
<em>procheck.prm</em> which controls the running of PROCHECK. When the task is run by
CCP4i, a default version of this file is copied to $CCP4_SCR if there is not one
there already. This file is then edited to set the parameter which controls whether
plots are colour or monochrome. If you wish to adjust any other PROCHECK
parameters, you should edit <em>$CCP4_SCR/procheck.prm</em> before running the task
(this will have to be done outside the Interface).</p>

<p>Note that when PROCHECK is run within the Interface, the output file names are
changed from the PROCHECK form (which is molecule_01_ramachand.ps,
molecule_02_allramach.ps <em>etc.</em>) to <em>molecule_jobnumber_ramachan.ps</em>,
<em>molecule_jobnumber_allramach.ps</em> <em>etc.</em> so file names are unique for
each run of the program.</p>
