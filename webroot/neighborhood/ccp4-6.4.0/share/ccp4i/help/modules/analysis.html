<p>The layout of each task window, <em>i.e.</em> the number of folders present,
and whether these folders are open or closed by default, depends on the choices
made in the <strong>Protocol</strong> folder of the task (see
<a href="../general/intro.html#task_window_format" target="_self">Introduction</a>).
Although certain folders are closed by default, there are specific reasons why you
should or may want to look at them. These reasons are described in the Task Window
Layout sections below.</p>

<h3><a name="areaimol"></a>Accessible Surface Area Calculations - AreaIMol</h3>

<p>The Areaimol task has a number of protocols to calculate the solvent
accessible surface areas (ASA) and area differences for a variety of
situations.</p>

<h4><a name="areaimol_protocols"></a>AreaIMol Protocols</h4>

<p><strong>Accessible Surface Area:</strong> calculates the accessible surface
area for all atoms of the requested type (protein or solvent). The effects of
intermolecular contacts due to symmetry-related molecules can also be included.</p>

<p><em>Treatment of waters:</em> normally ASA is calculated for protein
atoms only and waters (solvent) are ignored in the calculation. ASA can also be
calculated specifically for waters: if waters are treated as 'solvent' then
the ASA of individual waters will only be affected by the presence of
neighbouring protein atoms; if they are treated as 'protein' then individual
ASAs will also be affected by neighbouring waters.</p>

<p><strong>Area Differences For Protein:</strong> differences in ASA correspond
to buried area due to the interaction in question:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Oligomer formation:</strong> the supplied coordinate file should
contain coordinates which compromise a single protein 'unit' (<em>i.e.</em> monomer).
Define the symmetry operations to use to generate the oligomers. The first area
calculation will be for the oligomer, the second will be for the monomer. The
differences will be the change in ASA on the monomer when it is oligomerised.
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Crystallographic contacts:</strong> the supplied coordinate file
should contain coordinates which compromise a single copy of the protein.
Define the spacegroup which specifies the crystallographic symmetry. The first
area calculation will be for the protein in the crystal, the second will be for the
protein only. The differences will be the change in ASA on the protein when it
is placed within the crystal.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ligand/subunit binding:</strong> the supplied coordinate file
should contain the bound protein-ligand complex. Define the chains in the file
which constitute the ligand only. The first area calculation will be for the
protein-ligand complex, the second will be for the protein only. The
differences will be the change in ASA on the protein when the ligand is bound.
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Molecular binding:</strong> the supplied coordinate file
should contain the chains making up two or more molecules. Define molecules
in terms of the chains in the file which constitute each molecule of interest.
Calculations will then be performed for each pair of molecules to determine
the area buried in the interaction.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Area Differences For Waters:</strong> useful for looking for
buried waters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Waters with zero area in the first calculation are completely enclosed by
    protein.</li>
<li>Waters which have non-zero area in the first calculation but zero area in
    the second are enclosed between protein and/or other waters.</li>
<li>Waters which have non-zero area in both calculations are not completely
    enclosed by protein and/or waters and so are on the 'outside' of this shell.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="contact"></a>Analyse Molecular Contacts - Contact/Ncont</h3>

<p>Task for computing various types of contacts in protein structures. The
task runs with a choice of NCONT or CONTACT/ACT as the underlying program.
These programs give very similar analyses, but each one may be more convenient
in particular circumstances. Both NCONT and CONTACT use a bricking algorithm 
in which atoms are segregated into 6x6x6 &#197; boxes and contact searching is 
limited to neighbouring boxes; this is very fast. 
<p>
NCONT performs different kinds of searches with respect to what symmetry
operations and lattice translations are applied, and this should be selected
in the <strong>Protocol</strong> folder. See the 
<a href="../../../../html/ncont.html#cells" target="_PROGDOC">NCONT</a> documentation for a
detailed explanation.
<p>
CONTACT reads a standard Protein Data Bank file which must
contain SCALE cards if looking for metal-ligand or intermolecular contacts.</p>
<p>
For CONTACT, the maximum residue number is 9000. Maximum number of atoms is 48000.
There is no limit for NCONT.</p>

<h4><a name="contact_layout"></a>Contact - Task Window Layout</h4>

<p>Features to look out for in the Contact Task are:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Folder title</th><th>NCONT</th><th>CONTACT/ACT</th><th>Importance</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td>Symmetry operations</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Use spacegroup or list of operators to define symmetry operations</td>
<td>Spacegroup required if looking for <em>all</em> contacts. Choice of spacegroup or list of operators
required if looking for <em>metal-ligand</em> or <em>intermolecular contacts</em>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Atom Selection</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Define atoms involved in contacts</td>
<td>In NCONT mode, the program uses the atom selection syntax described in
the <a href="../../../../html/pdbcur.html#atom_selection" target="_PROGDOC">PDBCUR</a>
documentation. This can be added directly, or a
template created with the boxes provided and then edited if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Metal contact parameters</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Define metal coordination geometry</td>
<td>Define type of metal and expected metal-ligand distance</td></tr>

<h3><a name="pisa"></a>Analyse Protein Interfaces - PISA</h3>

<p>PISA (Protein Interfaces Surfaces and Assemblies) is a program for analysing
protein structures to look for assemblies of subunits, and the resulting
subunit interfaces and surfaces. This interface enables the standalone version
of the Pisa program to be run on a local machine.</p>

<p>The interface is run interactively in an iterative manner:</p>

<ul>
<li>First select the protocol option <strong>Generate new PISA
    analysis</strong> to run on a PDB file. This step stores data about
    the structure that can be interrogated in subsequent runs.</li>
<li>To perform a particular analysis, next select the protocol option
    <strong>Use a previous PISA analysis</strong> and select the job
    number for the previous run. Then, select a particular analysis
    option and run the task again to see the results.</li>
    webservice
</ul>

<h3><a name="pisa_web"></a>Launch PISA webservice - analyse protein interfaces</h3>

<p>PISA (Protein Interfaces Surfaces and Assemblies) is a webservice hosted at the
EBI which allows various analyses of protein structures. Structures can be taken from
the PDB archive by specifying an accession code, or can be uploaded from the user's
computer.</p>

<p>This is an alternative to the <a href="#pisa">Pisa task</a> run on the local
machine. See also the EBI PISA webservice page:
<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot_int/pistart.html" target="_self">PISA</a></p>

<h3><a name="baverage"></a>Temperature Factor Analysis - Baverage</h3>

<p>Generate graphs of average B-factor versus residue for each chain in the PDB file.
This task will launch loggraph directly to give a quick view of the graphs.
The graphs can still be viewed later via the View Files from Job button
applied to the task results.</p>

<p>See program documentation:
<a href="../../../../html/baverage.html" target="_PROGDOC">BAVERAGE</a>.</p>
