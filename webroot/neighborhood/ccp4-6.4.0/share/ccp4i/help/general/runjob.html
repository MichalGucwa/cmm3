<h3><a name="run_modes"></a>Run Modes</h3>

<p>Jobs can be run from the <strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> menubutton at the
bottom of task interfaces or from the <strong><tt>ReRun Job</tt></strong>
interface. There are three modes of running a job:

<dl>
<dt><strong><tt>Run Now</tt></strong></dt>
<dd>the task is run 'in background' - you can continue using the interface
while the job is running and can exit the interface without interrupting
the job.</dd>

<dt><strong><tt>Run &amp; View Com File</tt></strong></dt>
<dd>displays the command line and command file for the CCP4 program.
You can edit the command file. This could be useful if you want to use an
option not included in the Interface (but please let
<a href="mailto:ccp4gui@dl.ac.uk">us</a> know if there is
something useful missing).</dd>

<dt><strong><tt>Run Remote/Batch/Later</tt></strong></dt>
<dd>options to run a script on a remote machine (using the Unix system <em>rsh</em>
or <em>ssh</em> commands) and/or to start at a later time (using the system
<em>at</em> command).
And, if this is supported by your local system, to submit the job to a batch
queue. See <a href="#remote" target="_self">Running Jobs Remotely/Later/In Batch</a>.</dd>

<!--<dt><strong><tt>Append to Script</tt></strong></dt>
<dd>which allows chaining of tasks, <em>i.e.</em> building up one script which
runs two or more tasks.</dd>-->
</dl>

<h3><a name="remote"></a>Running Jobs Remotely/Later/In Batch</h3>

<p>Selecting this mode will bring up a window with a menu option to select whether
to run the job remotely, or later, or submit to batch. Not all of these options will
necessarily appear - it depends on your local setup which is defined in the file
<strong>$CCP4I_top/etc/resources.def</strong> and can be edited using the
<a href="database.html#configure_interface" target="_self"><tt>Configure Interface</tt></a> option at the bottom of the menu on the right hand side
of the Main Window.</p>

<p>The job is run remotely using either the <strong><em>rsh</em></strong> command -
this will only work for Unix machines on the same network which can see the same
file system. You will also need to ensure that remote login is possible without
the need to submit your password.</p>

<p>Delayed jobs are run using the <strong><em>at</em></strong> command and the time
input should be in a format suitable for <strong><em>at</em></strong>. A subset of
suitable formats is:

<dl>
<dt><strong>now</strong></dt>
<dd>run the job now</dd>

<dt><strong>now + n units</strong></dt>
<dd>where <strong>n</strong> is an integer and <strong>units</strong> is:
minutes, hours or days.</dd>

<dt><strong>HH:MM</strong></dt>
<dd>run the job at the time in hours and minutes of a 24-hour clock.</dd>

<dt><strong>HH:MM Day</strong></dt>
<dd>where <strong>Day</strong> is the full name of a day of the week.</dd>

<dt><strong>HH:MM Month Day</strong></dt>
<dd>where <strong>Month</strong> is a three-letter abbreviation of the month and
<strong>Day</strong> is a number.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>The status of the job reported in the Job List will be:

<dl>
<dt><strong>ON_HOLD</strong></dt>
<dd>for jobs not yet started on the local machine.</dd>

<dt><strong>RUNNING</strong></dt>
<dd>once job is started.</dd>

<dt><strong>REMOTE</strong></dt>
<dd>for jobs waiting to run or running on a remote machine or in batch.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the usual mechanism by which jobs report their status
to the main Interface, does not work across machines. To overcome this, the
Interface will periodically check on the contents of the log file and if
the usual termination statement is not present, it will assume the
task is still running. This means there may be a short delay (less than
a minute) before the termination is reported. Another possibility
to consider if a job appears to have taken a very long time is that
the script running on the remote machine has failed but the termination may not
be written to the log.</p>

<p>The <strong><tt>View Files from Job</tt></strong> option to
<strong><tt>View Log File</tt></strong> will list a log file being generated
on a remote machine.</p>

<!--<h3><a name="chaining"></a>Chaining Tasks</h3>

<p>&quot;Chaining&quot; is: running several tasks in one job, with carrying
over of parameters between consecutive tasks.</p>

<p>The chaining process is as follows:

<ol>
<li>Start with the first task in the chain and work through the task window
as normal.</li>

<li>Use the run function <strong><tt>Append to Script</tt></strong> to start the
chain. The jobs window will now display the CHAINING status for this task.</li>

<li>Open the task window for the next task in the chain and provide the
correct input. The File Selection window will now contain an extra listbox
containing the files created by previous tasks in the chain. These files
can be selected as input for the current task.</li>

<li>In the case of more than two tasks in a chain, repeat step 2 and 3
until the last task.<br />
For the last task in the chain, use the run function <strong><tt>Run Now</tt></strong>
or <strong><tt>Run Remote/Batch</tt></strong> to run the task chain. The jobs window
will display the present status of the job, followed by the names of the
tasks in the chain.</li>
</ol>

<p>The output information of all the tasks in the chain will be concatenated
to one <strong>.log</strong> file, which can be reviewed through the database menu
as normal.</p>

<p>A chained job can be rerun like any other job (see
<a href="database.html#rerun_job" target="_self">ReRun
Job</a>), with the additional option of only rerunning part of the chain.</p>

<p>Chaining is controlled by the <strong><tt>Manage Chain</tt></strong> option on
the Database menu - this is only available when you have a chain open.
See <a href="database.html#manage_chain" target="_self">Manage Chain</a>.</p>-->

<h3><a name="run_script"></a>How Jobs are Run</h3>

<p>You do NOT&nbsp;NEED to know what follows but you may be
interested or it may help in figuring out any problems.</p>

<p>A <strong>run script</strong> called
<strong><em>(job_number)_(task_name)</em>.def</strong>
(<em>e.g.</em>&nbsp;32_refmac.def) is created in the CCP4_DATABASE
subdirectory of the current project directory. This file begins
with a header section (lines beginning with <tt>#CCP4I</tt>) which
lists information about the job, e.g. the job ID, the taskname,
the server to be used, etc. The header is then followed by a list
of the parameters taken from the task interface. 

<p>
The <tt>.def</tt> file for the job is run by the script set by
<tt>$configure(RUN_CCP4I)</tt>, which defaults
to <tt>bin/ccp4i.tcl</tt>. The taskname is taken from the identifier 
in the header of the <tt>.def</tt> file so that the script can source 
the appropriate <em>taskname</em>.script file.

<p>The script is run as an independent process - it uses sockets
to send updates on progress back to the main interface.
The progress is recorded in the status column in the Job List.</p>

<p>As the task runs, the output is listed to a log file
<strong><em>(project_name)_(job_number)_(task_name)</em>.log</strong>.
The output from all the programs run will be concatenated into this
file. For some tasks there may also be some extra output from the run
script.</p>

<p>The run file could potentially be run external to the Interface with
the command:

<pRE><strong>ccp4ish -r <em>(job_number)_(task_name).def</em></strong></pre>

Note that <strong>ccp4ish</strong> is ccp4i without the graphics.

<p>To run each individual CCP4 program, the script creates a temporary file
which contains the command input. This is put in a file rather than simply
streamed to the program, because of limitations running on VMS. If you
are running the <strong><tt>Run&amp;View Com File</tt></strong> mode, the script will
pause here to display the com file and the run command line. You can edit
either of these before continuing.</p>

<p>To run the job on a remote machine or in batch, the Interface creates a short
<strong>.com</strong> file in the TEMPORARY directory. This will have the name
of the run script with an extra extension <strong>.com</strong>. The com file contains
the following:

<pRE><tt>setup_ccp4</tt>
<tt>/y/programs/ccp4i/bin/ccp4ish -r 163_scala.def </tt></pre>

<p>The first line is the command to setup CCP4 and the second line
is the full path name of the CCP4i program and the name of the run file.
This com file will not work if the path name for either the CCP4i directory or the
TEMPORARY directory are different on the remote machine.</p>
