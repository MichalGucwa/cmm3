<h3><a name="file_name_completion"></a>File Name Completion</h3>

<p>File name completion applies to the input file selection lines in the task interfaces
and should help you find files without using the full file selection window (as
described <a href="#browse" target="_self">below</a>). If you enter only the initial
letters of a file name and hit the Return/Enter key, a window will come up listing all
files whose names begin with those letters. You should select one file from the list.
You can also use wildcard characters (&quot;?&quot; for a single character or
&quot;*&quot; for one or more characters) and hit the Return/Enter
key to get a listing of all files which satisfy the search criteria.</p>

<h3><a name="browse"></a>File and Directory Selection through <tt>Browse</tt></a></h3>

<p>When the <strong><tt>Browse</tt></strong> button is clicked, a File or Directory
Selection window is opened. This window is expandable, and is laid out as follows:</p>

<img border="0" src="../images/fileselectwindow-9dec98-partblur.gif" alt="File and
Directory Selection Window" height="300" />

<p><a name="current_directory"></a>The <strong>Current Directory</strong> line has
a read-only label of the full path name of the current directory.</p>

<p><a name="file_entry"></a>The <strong>File Entry</strong> line has an entry field in
which to type a file or
directory name. It is possible to enter an <strong>environment variable</strong>
to get to a given directory or a <strong>search string</strong> which includes
some wildcard characters (&nbsp;?&nbsp;for a single character and * for a sequence
of zero or any number of characters). For example: typing in the string
&quot;<strong>*insulin*</strong>&quot; and then pressing the &lt;<tt>Return</tt>&gt; key
would find files with names: insulin.mtz, my_insulin.mtz, insulin_jan10
etc. and also any directory with insulin as part of its name. The hitlist
is displayed in the File List window below.<br />
<em>N.B.</em> When doing the wildcard search the Filename Filter is ignored.</p>

<p>A file name in the File Entry can be accepted either by pressing the
&lt;Return&gt; key while the focus is in the File Entry field or by clicking
the <strong><tt>OK</tt></strong>&nbsp;button at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p><a name="view"></a>Upon picking the <strong><tt>View</tt></strong> button (on the
right hand side of the File Entry line), some header information from the currently
selected file will be listed to a viewing window, which comes up separately. Note you
must have one filename selected in the File Entry field for this to work.</p>

<p><a name="choose_directory"></a>The <strong>Go to Directory</strong> line has
a pop-up menu button to enable selection of a directory from those set using the
<strong><tt>Directories&ProjectDir</tt></strong> button near the top right of
the main window. Upon selecting a different directory, the 'current directory' is
automatically adapted. Also on this line is a <strong><tt>Go up a directory</tt></strong>
button to extend the choice of directories when browsing for files.</p>

<p><a name="filename_filter"></a>The <strong>Filename Filter</strong> usually contains
the default file extension
but this can be changed if your files do not have a standard extension.<br />
<em>N.B.</em> The file extension <em>must</em> be entered in the following format:
<strong>*.mtz</strong>. Entering <strong>mtz</strong> is not sufficient.</p>

<p>Files may be <strong>sorted</strong> by <tt>name</tt> or <tt>date</tt> and
<strong>listed</strong> with just their <tt>file&nbsp;name</tt> or all their
<tt>file&nbsp;details</tt> (<em>i.e.</em> access code, size, date and filename).</p>

<!--<p><a name="chained_files"></a>The <strong>Chained Files</strong> listbox is not
usually present unless
you are using the chaining option to put several tasks in one script. If
you are chaining tasks, the ouput files from preceding tasks are
listed in this box so they can be selected as input for the current task.</p>-->

<p><a name="lists"></a>The <strong>Directory List</strong> and <strong>File List</strong>
are scrollable listboxes which contain lists of all the directories immediately below
the current directory (on the left) and all of the files in the current directory which
are consistent with the filename filter (on the right). The exception to this is if you
have just entered a search string
into the file entry field, in which case only the directories and files satisfying
that search string are listed. A single mouse click on a file will put
that file name in the File Entry field, a double click on the file
name will select the file and exit from the File Selection window. A click
on a directory name will make that directory the current directory.</p>

<p>The <strong><tt>OK</tt></strong> button will return any file name in the
File Entry field provided that when specifying an input file, the file
does exist. If you click on the <strong><tt>OK</tt></strong> button when no
file is selected or the name in the File Entry field is inappropriate,
the File Selection window will remain until you use the
<strong><tt>Cancel</tt></strong> button to exit.</p>

<p>The <strong><tt>Cancel</tt></strong> button will exit the File Selection and not
return any file name even if one is currently selected.</p>
