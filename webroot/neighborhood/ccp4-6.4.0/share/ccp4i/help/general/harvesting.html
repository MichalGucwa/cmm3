<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>From CCP4 release 4.0 onwards, dataset information is used to control the
writing of structure deposition files (also known as harvesting files).
Data harvesting aims to help simplify submission of structures to the database,
see <a href="../../../../html/harvesting.html">Data Harvesting</a>.
The CCP4 programs affected are
<a href="../../../../html/mosflm.html" target="_PROGDOC">MOSFLM</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/scala.html" target="_PROGDOC">SCALA</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/truncate.html" target="_PROGDOC">TRUNCATE</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/mlphare.html" target="_PROGDOC">MLPHARE</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/refmac.html" target="_PROGDOC">REFMAC</a> and
<a href="../../../../html/restrain.html" target="_PROGDOC">RESTRAIN</a>. 
Dataset information can either be supplied explicitly to the program,
or is taken from the MTZ file. The following data preparation programs 
can be used to add or adjust Project and Dataset names in the MTZ file:
<a href="../../../../html/scalepack2mtz.html" target="_PROGDOC">SCALEPACK2MTZ</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/dtrek2mtz.html" target="_PROGDOC">DTREK2MTZ</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/dtrek2scala.html" target="_PROGDOC">DTREK2SCALA</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/combat.html" target="_PROGDOC">Combat</a>,
<a href="../../../../html/f2mtz.html" target="_PROGDOC">F2MTZ</a> and
<a href="../../../../html/cad.html" target="_PROGDOC">CAD</a>.

<p>Provided a Project Name and a Dataset Name are specified (either explicitly or from the MTZ file)
and provided the NOHARVEST keyword is <em>not</em> given, the harvesting programs will
automatically produce a deposition file. This file will be written to
<pre>
<tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt>/<tt>DepositFiles</tt>/<i>&lt;projectname&gt;</i>/<i>&lt;datasetname&gt;.&lt;programname&gt;</i>
</pre>
The environment variable <tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt> defaults to the user's
home directory, but could be changed, for example, to a group project
directory. <tt>$HARVESTHOME</tt> may also be reset by CCP4i, see below.</p>

<p>The extra keywords associated with harvesting that are included in
the data harvesting programs are: 
<dl>
<dt>PNAME</dt>
<dd>Project Name. In most cases, this will be inherited from the MTZ file.</dd>
<dt>DNAME</dt>
<dd>Dataset Name. In most cases, this will be inherited from the MTZ file.</dd>
<dt>PRIVATE</dt>
<dd>Set the directory permissions to '700', <em>i.e.</em> read/write/execute for the user only (otherwise '755').</dd>
<dt>USECWD</dt>
<dd>Write the deposit file to the current directory, rather than a subdirectory of $HARVESTHOME.</dd>
<dt>RSIZE</dt>
<dd>Maximum width of a row in the deposit file (default 80).</dd>
<dt>NOHARVEST</dt>
<dd>Do not write out a deposit file; default is to do so provided Project and Dataset names are
available.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The CCP4 Interface does not do any additional data harvesting;
all this activity is in the data harvesting programs. However, CCP4i
contains options for controlling and customising data harvesting, and
these are described below.</p>

<h3><a name="pnames_and_dnames"></a>MTZ Project Names and Dataset Names in CCP4i</h3>

<p>The Project Name and Dataset Name used in data harvesting are part of
a wider organisation of reflection data, see general description of the
<a href="../../../../html/mtzformat.html">MTZ file format</a>. In brief,
columns in MTZ files are grouped according to datasets, which in turn are
grouped according to the crystal from which they were taken. Crystals belong
to particular projects. This formal structure is thus used in two distinct
ways:
<ol>
<li>To identify the origin of the various columns of data in the MTZ file,
for example MAD data where columns for each separate wavelength can be grouped 
together as one dataset. This is very necessary if certain manipulations, such as
scaling, are to be performed consistently on the data.</li>
<li>To carry the default project and dataset names which will be used as 
identifiers for the automated data harvesting. </li>
</ol></p>
<p>Depending on the context, CCP4i may refer to Project and Dataset Names
only, or may refer to Project, Crystal and Dataset Names.</p>

<h3><a name="creating_new_mtzs"></a>Creating New MTZs in CCP4i</h3>

<p>There are three tasks in the CCP4 Interface which import reflection data into MTZ format:
<ul>
<li>Import Scaled Data (running Scalepack2mtz or Dtrek2mtz program)</li>
<li>Import Unscaled Data (running Combat program)</li>
<li>Convert to/modify/extend MTZ (running f2mtz, cif2mtz or na4tomtz program)</li>
</ul>
In addition, in the 'Edit MTZ Datasets' task (program CAD), 
the Project, Crystal and Dataset names can be adjusted.</p>

<p>In all of these tasks you are required to enter Crystal, Project and Dataset names.
Your choices are important, as these names will define the data structure held
in the MTZ file. If you intend to merge the MTZ file with another, then
consider what names are already being used in the other file. For example,
should the new datasets belong to an existing crystal?</p>

<p>By default the project name will be the same as the CCP4i project name though 
this is not essential. This is different from the way the CCP4 programs themselves 
handle defaults for the project, crystal and dataset names (see, for instance, 
Scalepack2mtz <a href="../../../../html/scalepack2mtz.html#name" target="_PROGDOC">
NAME keyword</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="data_harvesting_in_ccp4i"></a>Data Harvesting in CCP4i</h3>

<p>Data harvesting is implemented for five different stages in the structure solution 
process and might be performed for the following tasks:</p>
<p><table border="1">
<tr><th align="left">Program function</th><th align="left">Interface Task(s)</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Integrating images (<a href="../../../../html/mosflm.html" target="_PROGDOC">Mosflm</a>)</td>
<td>Integrate Images</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scaling data (<a href="../../../../html/scala.html" target="_PROGDOC">Scala</a>)</td>
<td>Scale Experimental Intensities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Converting intensities to SFs (<a href="../../../../html/truncate.html" target="_PROGDOC">Truncate</a>)</td>
<td><li>Import Scaled Denzo Data  (optional)<br />
<li>Scale Experimental Intensities (optional)<br />
<li>Convert Intensities to SFs<br />
<li>Convert to/modify/extend MTZ (optional for some formats)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Final round of refinement of heavy atom positions
(<a href="../../../../html/mlphare.html" target="_PROGDOC">Mlphare</a>)</td>
<td>Run Mlphare</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Final round of refinement (<a href="../../../../html/refmac.html" target="_PROGDOC">Refmac</a>)</td>
<td>Run Refmac</td>
</tr>
</table></p>
<p>For each task which might involve harvesting, there is a folder
in the task window, usually immediately below the Files folder, where you can 
change the destination for harvest files and change the Project or Dataset Names.
For the Mosflm task, it is necessary to define Project, Crystal and Dataset Names
for the newly-created MTZ file, whether or not a harvesting file is to be produced.
For the other tasks, it is possible to enter an alternative Project or Dataset name 
to override the ones obtained from the MTZ file.</p>

<p>In addition to the dataset information, the task interfaces give four
options for controlling output of harvest files:
<dl>
<dt>Create harvest file in project harvesting directory
<dd>The harvest file is placed in a subdirectory "DepositFiles" of the
project directory corresponding to the currently selected  CCP4i project.
This option allows the user to organise the harvesting files according
to CCP4i projects. This works by CCP4i temporarily re-setting the
environment variable HARVESTHOME.

<dt>Create harvest file in central harvesting directory
<dd>The harvest file is placed in a subdirectory "DepositFiles" of the directory 
defined by the environment variable HARVESTHOME. This may be defined for your 
installation in the ccp4.setup file. If HARVESTHOME is not set in the
environment, then HOME is used. This option acts as a central location for
a user or group.

<dt>Use current working directory
<dd>This corresponds to the program keyword USECWD (see above), where in
the context of CCP4i the current working directory is the project directory
(note: <em>not</em> the "DepositFiles" subdirectory thereof).

<dt>Do not create harvest file
<dd>Do not create any harvest files. This corresponds to the program 
keyword NOHARVEST (see above).
</dl>

<!-- There was no documentation on harvesting in the programmer's section - pjx
<h4><a name="implementation"></a>Implementation</h4>

<p>See <a href="../programmers/harvest.html" target="_PROGRAMMERSDOCS">Implementing Data Harvesting</a>.</p>
-->

<h4><a name="preferences"></a>Preferences</h4>

<p>CCP4i allows for the automatic setting of certain
<a href="preferences.html#data_harvesting" target="_self">preferences</a> for 
data harvesting, via the CCP4i Preferences window (accessed from the menu on the
right-hand side of the Main Window). The default option for controlling output 
of harvest files (see above) can be set. The harvest directories can be
made private, corresponding to the program keyword PRIVATE, and the maximum
width of an output row can be set, corresponding to the program keyword RSIZE 
(see above).</p>
