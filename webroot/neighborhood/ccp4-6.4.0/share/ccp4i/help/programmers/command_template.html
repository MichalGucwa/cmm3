<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>First read the
<a href="overview.html" target="_self">Overview</a> of the
files required for a task interface.</p>

<p>It is common in scripts to run CCP4 programs to redirect the command
input from the script file using &lt;&lt; but in CCP4i the commands are
written to a separate file (chiefly to enable VMS&nbsp;support). Command
templates are used to generate the command files for CCP4 (or other) programs.</p>

<p>The procedure <em>CreateComScript</em> will substitute parameters into
the template to create a command file. There is usually one command template
file per program, though if program function is very modular it may be
reasonable to have separate templates for different functions (<em>e.g.</em> see
the <em>amore_*.com</em> templates in <em>$CCP4I_top/templates</em>). Note
that the templates are all kept in the directory <em>$CCP4I_top/templates</em>.
Before writing a new task interface, check here for existing templates
for program(s) you may want to use - particularly because the rest
of the task interface must use the same parameter names that are used in
the template.</p>

<h3><a name="using_createcomscript"></a>Using CreateComScript in a Script File</h3>

<p>The <em>CreateComScript</em> procedure is usually called from a run script
- a few example lines of a run script might be:</p>

<pre>
set TITLE &quot;This should be a really good fiddle&quot;
set FACTOR_1 0.1
set FACTOR_2 400
set FACTOR_3 27.1
set EXTRA_FIDDLE 1

CreateComScript $CCP4I_top/templates/fiddleprog.com fp_script
</pre>

<p>The first argument to<em> CreateComScript</em> is the name of the <em>fiddleprog</em>
template file and the second argument returns the name of a temporary file
which is created and will contain the command lines:</p>

<pre>
title&nbsp;'This should be a really good fiddle'
fiddlefactors 0.1 400 -
27.1
</pre>

<p>Note that the values of the parameters set in the run file are not
passed to the <em>CreateComScript</em> procedure - a bit of Tcl black magic
enables it to see the variables at the higher, calling, level in the stack.</p>

<h3><a name="intro_file_format"></a>Introduction to the Template File Format</h3>

<p>The commands for many CCP4 programs are very complex with many optional
keywords and subkeywords and variable numbers of parameters. The format
of the template file is designed so that only the required keywords, subkeywords
and parameters are written to the command file - in most cases nothing
will be written so:</p>

<li>the program will be able to choose its own defaults</li>

<li>if the user chooses to look at the command file it will be as simple
as possible </li>

<p>In order to implement this, each command line must be broken down into
its various components and with the option of an independent decision whether
or not to write each component to the command file.</p>

<h3><a name="parameter_substitution"></a>Parameter Substitution and the Write Flag</h3>

<p>To control whether a command line is written or not, the first parameter
on a standard line in the template file is a logical variable. For example
to create a command line:</p>

<pre>
resolution 10.0 3.0
</pre>

<p>the line in the template file could be:</p>

<pre>
$SET_RESOLUTION_LIMITS resolution $RESOLUTION_MIN $RESOLUTION_MAX
</pre>

<p>Any word on the template line beginning with <tt>$</tt> will be treated as a
variable and the value substituted. Thus the line above requires the parameters
<tt>SET_RESOLUTION_LIMITS</tt>, <tt>RESOLUTION_MIN</tt> and <tt>RESOLUTION_MAX</tt>
to be set. The values of these variables will be substituted into the template line.
All other words will be retained as they are.</p>

<p>The first word in the template line is treated as a
<strong><em>write flag</em></strong>. It must be a logical with value 1 (true) or
0 (false). A line will only be written to the command file if the write flag is true.
The write flag is not written to the command file.</p>

<p>If a line should always be written, the write flag can be given a
fixed value of 1:</p>

<pre>
1 resolution $RESOLUTION_MIN $RESOLUTION_MAX
</pre>

<p>If the decision whether to write the line is more complex, a more
complex function can be used, providing it has a logical (<em>i.e.</em> 0 or 1)
result, for example:</p>

<pre>
{ $SET_RESOLUTION_LIMITS &amp;&amp; $RESOLUTION_MAX &gt; 0.0 } resolution $RESOLUTION_MIN $RESOLUTION_MAX
</pre>

<p>For the command line to be written, $SET_RESOLUTION_LIMITS must
be true and $RESOLUTION_MAX must be greater than zero. Note that the
write flag function is enclosed in curly braces <tt>{}</tt> and is in the Tcl
language. Examples of some functions which might be useful, are given
<a href="#appendix" target="_self">below</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="splitting_commands"></a>Splitting Commands into Components - Continuation Lines</h3>

<p>The definition of one command may be spread over several lines in the
template file. Each line of the template file is processed independently
so each of the components of the command is treated independently. Thus for
an example command line:</p>

<pre>
fiddlefactors &lt;factor_1&gt; &lt;factor_2&gt; [ &lt;factor_3&gt; ]
</pre>

<p>where the third parameter &lt;factor_3&gt; is optional, the template
might be:</p>

<pre>
1 fiddlefactors $FACTOR_1 $FACTOR_2
- $EXTRA_FIDDLE&nbsp;$FACTOR_3
</pre>

<p>The first line will always be written, as it has a write flag of 1.</p>

<p>The second line encodes a component of the command which will only be written
if the parameter <tt>$EXTRA_FIDDLE</tt> is 1 (true).
The <tt>-</tt> character at the beginning of
the second line indicates that it is a continuation of the preceding line. In
CCP4 command files the continuation character goes on the end of the preceding line.
The reason for the different convention here will become apparent
<a href="#double_continuation" target="_self">later</a>.
Of course, when the template file is processed, the resulting command file has the
continuation character at the end of the preceding line.</p>

<p>An alternative form for the template is:</p>

<pre>
$SET_FIDDLEFACTORS fiddlefactors $FACTOR_1 $FACTOR_2
- $EXTRA_FIDDLE $FACTOR_3
</pre>

<p>Here writing the first line is dependent on the value of the parameter
<tt>$SET_FIDDLEFACTORS</tt>. If this is 1 (true), the command line is written
as above, but if it is 0 (false), nothing is written. The second, continuation,
line is NOT written if the preceding line is not written.</p>

<p>Analysing command lines can result in several components which can be
written as continuation lines, <em>e.g.</em> the refi command in the refmac
interface:</p>

<pre>
1 refi
- 1 type $REFINE_TYPE
- $IFRESI resi $RESIDUAL
- 1 meth $MINIMISATION
</pre>

<p>Note that if the <tt>$IFRESI</tt> parameter were 0, the resi keyword
would not be written out but the subsequent meth keyword would still be
written.</p>

<h4><a name="sub_components"></a>Sub-components and Double-Continuation</h4>

<p>There are a few complex commands which can be interpreted as having
sub-components of the components and these are represented as starting
with <tt>--</tt> on a line. The line will only be written if the preceding command
line and component line are written. For example in the fft template file:</p>

<pre>
1 exclude
- $EXCLUDE_BYSIGMA sig1 $EXCLUDE_BYSIGMA_1
-- [IfSet $EXCLUDE_BYSIGMA_2] sig2 $EXCLUDE_BYSIGMA_2
- $EXCLUDE_MINIMUM f1min $EXCLUDE_MINIMUM_1
-- [IfSet $EXCLUDE_MINIMUM_2] f2min $EXCLUDE_MINIMUM_2
</pre>

<p>The sub-component keywords <em>sig2</em> and <em>f2min</em> will only be
written out if the preceding components are written and if their own write
flag function is true (the <em>IfSet</em> procedure is described more fully
in the <a href="indexframeset.html" target="_blank">library of CCP4i commands</a>
- essentially it checks that a parameter is not an empty string).</p>

<p>Where there is a 'double-continuation' in the template file, only a
single continuation will be written to the end of the preceding line in
the command file.</p>

<p><a name="double_continuation"></a><em>The continuation character in the
template file is put at the beginning of lines rather than the end so the
'double-continuation character' of sub-components can be used unambiguously.</em></p>

<h4><a name="inline_else"></a>The <tt>|</tt> character - an inline ELSE</h4>

<p>If there is a <tt>|</tt> character in the template line, the interpretation
of the write flag is changed. If the write flag is 1 (true), the words
<em>preceding</em> the <tt>|</tt> character will be written to the command file. If the
write flag is 0 (false), the words <em>after</em> the <tt>|</tt> character will be written
to the command file. In this case, there is NO option not to write to the command
file.</p>

<p>An example from the scala template:</p>

<pre>
$TAILS_FIX_V FIX V | UNFIX V
</pre>

<p>Dependent on the value of $TAILS_FIX_V, either &quot;FIX V&quot; or
&quot;UNFIX V&quot; will be written to the command file.</p>

<p>This is equivalent to (see
<a href="#if_else_endif" target="_self">section on
IF-ELSE-ENDIF</a>):</p>

<pre>
IF $TAILS_FIX_V
 1 FIX V
ELSE
 1 UNFIX V
ENDIF
</pre>

<h3><a name="undefined_parameters"></a>Undefined Parameters and Why Split Commands into Components</h3>

<p>Many template files contain a large number of variables but it is not
necessary to set values for all of them in order to use the template file.
The template file is processed one line at a time and if ANY parameter
in the line is not set, the line will not be written (it will be treated
as if the write flag was 0 (false)). A major incentive to split commands
into component lines is that if a parameter is not set for one component
it will not stop other components being processed and written successfully.</p>

<p>Note that a parameter can be set to the empty string:</p>

<pre>
set RESOLUTION &quot;&quot;
</pre>

<p>and it will still be considered as defined. This can lead to errors
in the command file where parameters are 'missing'. You need to check that
parameters are not just an empty string using the IfSet procedure.</p>

<!--
<p><font color="#ff0000">NOTE: THIS&nbsp;IS&nbsp;HORRIBLE&nbsp;- at least
IfSet should be called something more sensible.</font></p>
-->

<h3><a name="control_structures"></a>Control Structures</h3>

<p>The command template format supports control structures of the form
IF-ELSE-ENDIF, LOOP and CASE. Note that the keywords MUST be uppercase
and written on separate lines. It is permissible to nest LOOPs and IFs.</p>

<p>The control structures can be used within the definitions for a single
command or around one or more commands.</p>

<h4><a name="if_else_endif"></a>IF-ELSE-ENDIF</h4>

<p>IF-ELSE-ENDIF has the form:</p>

<pre>
IF { logical_function }
..
..
ELSE
..
..
ENDIF
</pre>

<p>The ELSE component is optional. An example from the refmac template:</p>

<pre>
1 refi
 - 1 type $REFINE_TYPE
 - 1 resi $RESIDUAL
 - 1 meth $MINIMISATION
IF { [StringSame $REFINE_TYPE IDEA RIGID] }
 - $B_REFINEMENT bref over
ELSE
 - $B_REFINEMENT bref $B_REFINEMENT_MODE
ENDIF
</pre>

<p>Here the IF-ELSE-ENDIF is used with the definition of the refi
command. The <em>StringSame</em> procedure is being used to test if $REFINE_TYPE is
set to IDEA or RIGID and the line written to the command file depends on the result.</p>

<p>The logical function could be a variable name or any Tcl function.</p>

<h4><a name="loop"></a>LOOP-ENDLOOP</h4>

<p>LOOP-ENDLOOP has the form:</p>

<pre>
LOOP loop_variable start_value end_value
..
..
ENDLOOP
</pre>

<p>The loop variable should be a simple name (<em>e.g.</em> &quot;n&quot;); the value
of the loop variable can be accessed inside the loop (<em>e.g.</em> as &quot;$n&quot;).
The start_value and end_value should be integers, end_value should be greater
than start_value. Currently there is no option for increment values other
than 1.</p>

<p>An example from the refmac template to write out scaling factors for
a variable number of partials:</p>

<pre>
IF { $NPARTIALS &gt; 0 }
1 scpa
  LOOP N 1 $NPARTIALS
   - 1 $PARTIAL_SCALE($N)
  ENDLOOP
ENDIF
</pre>

<h4><a name="case"></a>CASE-CASEMATCH-ENDCASE</h4>

<p>CASE-CASEMATCH-ENDCASE has the form:</p>

<pre>
CASE $case_variable
CASEMATCH value_1
..
CASEMATCH value_2
..
......
..
CASEMATCH value_n
..
..
ENDCASE
</pre>

<p>The action depends on whether the value of <em>case_variable</em> matches
any of the values <em>value_1</em>, <em>value_2</em>, .. <em>value_n</em>.</p>

<p>An example from the refmac template in generating the weight
command. The parameters written to the command file depend on the value of
<tt>$WEIGHTING_METHOD</tt>:</p>

<pre>
1 weight
 - { !$EXPERIMENTAL_WEIGHTING } NOEX
CASE $WEIGHTING_METHOD
CASEMATCH MATRIX
 - 1 MATRIX $MATRIX_WEIGHT
CASEMATCH GRADIENT
 - 1 GRADIENT $GRADIENT_WEIGHT
CASEMATCH SIGMA
 - 1 SIGMA $SIGMA_WEIGHT
ENDCASE
</pre>

<p>NOTE that in { !$EXPERIMENTAL_WEIGHTING } the '!' means 'not' and so this
statement is true if $EXPERIMENTAL_WEIGHTING is set to zero (<em>i.e.</em> false).

below</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="labelline"></a>LABELLINE - Writing LABIN and LABOUT Commands</h3>

<p>The usual form for LABELLINE is:</p>

<pre>
LABELLINE label_keyword program_label_list label_index
</pre>

<p>The label_keyword is usually LABIN, or LABOUT. It could be the continuation
character <tt>-</tt> if it is a continuation from a previous LABELLINE.
The program_label_list is a list of program labels. The label_index is optional
and, if used, should be a positive integer value.</p>

<p>For example if the following parameters are set:</p>

<pre>
set LABIN &quot;F1 SIGF1 PHI&quot;
set F1 FP
set SIGF1 SIGFP
set PHI PHIC
</pre>

<p>then the template line:</p>

<pre>
LABELLINE labin $LABIN
</pre>

<p>will result in the command line:</p>

<pre>
labin F1 = FP -
SIGF1 = SIGFP -
PHI = PHIC
</pre>

<p>For each of the program labels listed in the variable $LABIN the
appropriate assignment has been written to the command file. The program_label_list
does not need to be a variable; the line:</p>

<pre>
LABELLIST labin &quot;F1 SIGF1 PHI&quot;
</pre>

<p>with the program labels grouped inside double inverted commas, would
also work. Many programs have variable program labels dependent on their
mode of use and it is usually advisable to make the program_label_list
a variable which is set in the
<a href="task_windows.html#taskname_run" target="_self"><em>taskname_run</em>
procedure</a>.</p>

<p>Some programs have 'indexed' program labels which usually correspond
to derivatives numbered 1 to n. So, for example, for MLPHARE, the usual
program labels (with no anomalous data) are: FP SIGFP FPH1
SIGFPH1 .. FPHn SIGFPHn. The template lines for these are:</p>

<pre>
LABELLINE labin &quot;FP SIGFP&quot;
LOOP n 1 $N_DERIVS
 LABELLINE - &quot;FPH SIGFPH&quot; $n
ENDLOOP
</pre>

<h3><a name="at"></a>AT - Including the contents of an external file</h3>

<p>The AT construct allows the contents of an external com file to be included
in the final com file. An example of its usage is:</p>

<pre>
AT { [FileJoin [GetEnvPath CCP4I_TOP] templates harvest.com] }
</pre>

<p>The instructions that the referenced file contains will be processed within
the current context and the resulting commands written to the output com file
at the position of the AT command.</p>

<p><strong>Known Bug With The AT Command</strong></p>

<p>There is a known bug with the AT mechanism when used within a LOOP
construct to include several different external files. In these
circumstances each AT command will insert the contents of all the
previously read AT commands within the loop. (AT commands outside the
loop are not affected.) The use of the AT mechanism in these situations
is therefore deprecated.</p>

<h3><a name="hints"></a>Hints for Programmers</h3>

<p>When writing a task interface, write the command template file first.
It will give you a chance to look at the details of the program input.</p>

<p>Use existing templates wherever possible. Contact the
<a href="mailto:ccp4gui@dl.ac.uk">Interface developers</a>
if you want to check if a template has been recently created or if
you have some argument with an existing template.</p>

<p>If you are the first person to write a template for a particular program,
please do not take short cuts (for example leaving out keywords that you
do not want to use or making assumptions of parameters being equivalent
where it is not necessarily so). This just makes for problems in the future.
</p>

<p>Split commands into components.</p>

<p>If there is an error in the template file, the resultant error messages
are not always very helpful so you need to be able to spot errors in the
file. Use indentation to make the control structure of the template file
more obvious.</p>

<p>90% of errors in the template file are forgetting to put a <em>write
flag</em> in a command line or are typos in variable names.</p>

<p>It is not necessary that every parameter in the command template maps
onto a widget in the task window seen by the user. Some parameters may
be irrelevant for a particular task and it is often desirable to present
the user with fewer, simplified parameters - these can be expanded to the
parameters required by the template file at either of two stages: in
the taskname_run procedure or in the task script.</p>

<p>The easiest way to test a template file is simultaneously with testing
the task window. Use the <em>Run&amp;ViewComFile</em> option when running
the task so you can see the resultant command file and check it is what
you expect for the parameters set in the task window.</p>

<h3><a name="appendix"></a>Appendix: Some Examples of Write Flags</h3>

<p>This is intended as a very quick introduction to the snippets of Tcl
that you may need to use in defining a write flag. Note that <em>IfSet</em>
and <em>StringSame</em> are CCP4i procedures and are documented in the
<em>Text Handling Utilities</em> section of the
<a href="indexframeset.html" target="_blank">library of CCP4i commands</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="example_1"></a>
<pre>
{ [IfSet $TITLE] } title $TITLE
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>write the title command line if the <tt>$TITLE</tt> string is not empty.</dd>

<dt><a name="example_2"></a>
<pre>
{ [regexp MIN $REFINE_MODE] } ......
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>write the line if the string in variable <tt>$REFINE_MODE</tt> includes
the string <tt>MIN</tt> (<em>N.B.</em> it does not have to be an exact match). <em>regexp</em>
is a very powerful regular expression procedure, of which the full range of functionality
is described very tersely in the
<a href="http://sunscript.sun.com/man/tcl8.1/TclCmd/regexp.htm" target="_blank">Tcl
documentation</a>
<!--
<font color="#ff0000">(I'm looking for a good introduction to regexp - anyone know a good
reference?)</font>.</dd>
-->

<dt><a name="example_3"></a>
<pre>
{[StringSame $REFINE_MODE MINI MAXI ]} ....
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>write the line if the string in variable <tt>$REFINE_MODE</tt> is an exact
match to any of the subsequent arguments to the <em>StringSame</em> procedure.
Note that the procedure can have two or more arguments.</dd>

<dt><a name="example_4"></a>
<pre>
{[expr $N - 1] == $HIT_VALUE } ....
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>the line is written if $N -1 is equal to <tt>$HITVALUE</tt>. All arithmetic operations
in Tcl should be done with the <em>expr</em> procedure (see the
<a href="http://sunscript.sun.com/man/tcl8.1/TclCmd/expr.htm" target="_blank">Tcl
documentation</a>).
The Tcl operators such as == are also described in the <em>expr</em> documentation.</dd>

<dt><a name="example_5"></a>
<pre>
!$FIX unfix
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>write out &quot;unfix&quot; if NOT <tt>$FIX</tt>. The exclamation mark is the
'not' operator.</dd>

<dt><a name="example_6"></a>
<pre>
{ $TEST_1 &amp;&amp; $TEST_2 } ....
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>the line is written if both <tt>$TEST_1</tt> and <tt>$TEST_2</tt> are true</dd>

<dt><a name="example_7"></a>
<pre>
{ $TEST_1 || $TEST_2 } ....
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>the line is written if <tt>$TEST_1</tt> or <tt>$TEST_2</tt> is true</dd>

<dt><a name="example_8"></a>
<pre>
{ ($TEST_1 &amp;&amp; $TEST_2) || $TEST_3 } ..
</pre>
</dt>
<dd>the line is written if both <tt>$TEST_1</tt> and <tt>$TEST_2</tt> are true OR if
<tt>$TEST_3</tt> is true</dd>

</body>
</html>
