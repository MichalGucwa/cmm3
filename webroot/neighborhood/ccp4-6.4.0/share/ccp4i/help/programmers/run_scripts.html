<h3><a name="definitions"></a>Run Scripts</h3>

<p>See documentation on <a href="../general/runjob.html#run_script" target="_MAIN">How Jobs are Run.</a></p>

<p>Every task <em>taskname</em> must have a run script file
$CCP4I_top/script/<em>taskname</em>.script. 
The simplest run script will just run the required program, but a complex
script could run several programs, include some quite complex flow control
and possibly do other work such as analysing the log file output from the
programs. The run scripts are written in the Tcl scripting language though
technically it should be possible to use alternative scripting languages in
this context within the general framework of CCP4i.</p>
There is a
<a href="indexframeset.html" target="_PROGRAMMERSDOCS">library of CCP4i
commands</a>, some of which are specific for run scripts, 
which simplify script writing.</p>

<p>A simple script to run one program will do three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>define the command line for the program</li>
<li>write a command script (if the program requires a script)</li>
<li>use the CCP4i library command
<a href="Execute.html" target="_INDEXMAIN"><tt>Execute</tt></a> to run the program</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides running the program, the <tt>Execute</tt> command has functionality
to enable the user to view and edit the command line or input script, and
functionality to terminate the run script cleanly if the program fails.
This command requires, as input, the command line to run the program and
the script that the program will read.</p>

<p>For any program which requires command script input (<em>i.e.</em> most CCP4
programs) the run script must generate the command script. There are two
means to generate command scripts: either they can be written explicitly
(which is good for short, simple scripts) or they can be generated
automatically using the program command templates.</p>

<p>To write command scripts explicitly, use the
<a href="WriteFile.html" target="_INDEXMAIN"><tt>WriteFile</tt></a> and
<a href="GetTmpFileName.html" target="_INDEXMAIN"><tt>GetTmpFileName</tt></a>
commands, for example:</p>

<pre>
WriteFile [set tmp_script [GetTmpFileName -ext _com]] \
"MODE UPDATE $ARP_UPDATE_MODE
CELL $CELL_1 $CELL_2 $CELL_3 $CELL_4 $CELL_5 $CELL_6
SYMM $SPACE_GROUP  \nEND"
</pre>

<p>Command templates are described
<a href="command_template.html" target="_self">elsewhere</a>. There is
usually one command template per program. If the same program is used by more than
one task (<em>e.g.</em> the FFT program is used by both the 'FFT' and the 'Generate
Patterson' tasks), the same command template can be reused. The CCP4i library
command <a href="CreateComFile.html" target="_INDEXMAIN"><tt>CreateComFile</tt></a>
requires the name of a command template file
as argument and will create a command script by substituting the parameters
set in the run file into the command template. This requires a feat which
might seem impossible to Fortran programmers: the <tt>CreateComFile</tt>
command must be able to 'see' the parameters set in the run file without
them been explicitly passed to the command. This is achieved using the
Tcl <tt>uplevel</tt> command. The <tt>CreateComFile</tt> command
returns the name of the command script which can then be passed on to the
<tt>Execute</tt> command.</p>

<p>All of the parameters set in the task interface are written to a .def file which
is read by the <em>ccp4ish</em> process and all of the parameters set in the .def file
are visible when <em>ccp4ish</em> sources the run script. The .def file
for a job also contains come job control parameters at the top of the file;
these are on lines beginning with #CCP4I. These parameters are loaded into an array called
<tt>job_params</tt> which is accessed by the CCP4i library routines such as 
<tt>Execute</tt> and <tt>TerminateScript</tt>.</p>
