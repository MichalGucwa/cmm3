<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>A task window file defines the appearance of a task window. The file
is written in the Tcl scripting language but all essential functionality
is provided by a small library of CCP4i commands so, at least for simpler
interfaces, the programmer needs only minimal knowledge of Tcl. There is
an example task window file <strong><em>$CCP4I_top/tasks/demo.tcl</em></strong>
which will be referred to below.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Tcl, you should look at the
<a href="tcl_intro.html" target="_self">Introduction to Tcl</a>.
You should perhaps read quickly through this before looking at the demo file
and then refer back when features of the demo need some explanation.</p>

<h3><a name="procedures_and_arrays"></a>The Procedures and Arrays in a Task Window File</h3>

<p>For a task called <strong><em>taskname</em></strong> (as defined in the
<em>modules</em> file) there must be a file called
<strong><em>taskname</em>.tcl</strong> in the directory
<strong>$CCP4I_top/tasks</strong>. This file must define a procedure
<strong><em>taskname</em>_task_window</strong>
which contains the definition of the graphical interface to the task. This
procedure will be called when the user selects the task from the menu in
the main CCP4i window. The file can also contain three other procedures:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a name="taskname_setup"></a><strong><em>taskname</em>_setup</strong></dt>
<dd>which is called prior to <em>taskname</em>_task_window. This can be used
to perform any initialisation and is particularly used for defining menus</dd>
<dt><a href="#taskname_run" target="_self"><strong><em>taskname</em>_run</strong></a></dt><dd>is also optional and will
be called when the user picks the <strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> button on the
task window. It can be used to do any checking and 'tidying up' of parameters
before running the task.</dd>
<dt><a href="#taskname_prereq" target="_self"><strong><em>taskname</em>_prereq</strong></a></dt>
<dd>This is an optional procedure which is invoked when the main interface
window displays the list of tasks available to the user. It can be used to
perform any checks for "prerequisites" for running the task - for example,
to check if a particular executable is available on the system.<dd>
</dl>

<p>The <em>taskname.tcl</em> file is not read until the user selects to run
the task and then the three procedures described above are called automatically
by the core (<em>i.e.</em> the main part) of CCP4i when required. Most of the
functionality of these procedures is achieved by calls to the library of CCP4i
procedures so the task window file is basically providing the meat in a
sandwich.</p>

<p>All the variables associated with one instance of a task window are
saved as elements of one array. This is necessary for keeping everything
together and avoiding possible clashes where, for example, two different
tasks, open simultaneously, might both have a variable called
<tt>RESOLUTION_MIN</tt>. The interface is implemented so that, in principle,
it is possible to have two windows interfacing to the <strong>same</strong>
task open simultaneously, and with each window having an independent set of
parameters which are stored in different arrays (in practice, however, this
option has been disabled to avoid confusing the user). The actual name of
the array is decided by the CCP4i core before it calls any of the task
procedures and the name is then passed to the procedures as an argument.
In practice the name of the array is usually the same as the
<em>taskname</em> but you should not assume this is always so.</p>

<p>When the name of an array is passed to a procedure, it is necessary to
associate that name with a local variable using the <tt>upvar</tt> command.
An example of the syntax of this, taken from the <em>demo.tcl</em> file:</p>

<pre>
proc demo_task_window { arrayname } {
upvar #0 $arrayname array
...
....
}
</pre>

<p><tt>arrayname</tt> will contain the true name of the array when it is
passed into the procedure. The true name of the array is substituted for
<tt>$arrayname</tt> in the <tt>upvar</tt> command so that the <tt>upvar</tt>
command is given the true name of the array and equivalences it to the
local variable <tt>array</tt>. In the task window files that I have written,
including the demo.tcl, I have always used the very generic words <tt>arrayname</tt>
for the argument and <tt>array</tt> for the local variable. The important
point to remember, assuming you use the same convention, is: within the
procedure all references to the array should use the word <tt>array</tt>
<strong>except</strong> if the name of the array is being passed on to
another procedure in which case <tt>$arrayname</tt> should be used.</p>

<p>Within the graphical interface, the names of the parameters should be
the same, or similar to, the program parameter names (assuming the program
has 'sensible' parameter names!) and are commonly upper case so they
stand out in scripts. So the significance of parameter names such as
<tt>RESOLUTION_MIN</tt> and <tt>RESOLUTION_MAX</tt> should be obvious.
Within the task window files, these names are actually used as array indices
so that if you need to access these variables, they are
array(<tt>RESOLUTION_MIN</tt>) and array(<tt>RESOLUTION_MAX</tt>).
In practice you should not often need to access these parameters but you
will just pass their names on to library routines.</p>

<h3><a name="windows_and_widgets"></a>Windows and Widgets</h3>

<p>Tk is the part of the Tcl/Tk package responsible for the graphics. Programming
a task window does not require direct use of Tk - the CCP4i command library
provides higher level functionality.</p>

<p>Each graphical element in Tk is called a widget. Tk has an hierarchical
arrangement of widgets - a child widget (<em>i.e.</em> one that is the next layer
down in the hierarchy) is drawn within its parent. For example, a very simplified
view of the hierarchy for a task window is:</p>

<p>task window -&gt; frame/folder -&gt; line -&gt; labels and input widgets</p>

<p>If you look at the task window it is horizontally partitioned into 'frames'
(<em>i.e.</em> protocol frame and files frame) and folders and these frames are,
fairly obviously, defined in terms of lines. This layout is not inherent
in Tk but is built into the CCP4i command library. The <tt>CreateTaskWindow</tt>
command is used to create a window with the conventional format. The
<tt>OpenFolder</tt> command is used to specify where the definition of a folder
begins. The <tt>CreateLine</tt> command is used to define an entire line in
the window and its arguments include the definition of the labels and input
widgets on that line.</p>

<p>In Tk each widget has an id which is formatted rather like the format
for directories in UNIX, except that a '.' is used as a separator instead
of a '/'. In UNIX the root directory is '/' and in Tk the main widow
of an application is named '.'. A child widget of '.' would be <em>.foo</em>.
A child of <em>.foo</em> would be <em>.foo.bar</em> and so on.</p>

<p>In CCP4i the task windows usually have names <em><tt>.taskname</tt></em>.
Because of the complexities of setting up scroll bars, message lines and toggleable
frames (all dealt with by the <tt>CreateTaskWindow</tt> command), the components
of the task window have lengthy, complex names. The programmer does not usually
need to be concerned with these, but the commands which create frames
and lines do return the id for the frame or line which a programmer would
need to customise the interface using Tk commands directly.</p>

<h3><a name="CCP4I_library"></a>The CCP4i Library Commands to Draw Windows</h3>

<p>To follow this section, look for examples of the library commands described
below in the file <strong>$CCP4I_top/tasks/demo.tcl</strong> and look at the demo
task window. The library commands are described more fully in the
<a href="indexframeset.html" target="_PROGRAMMERSDOCS">command
documentation</a>.</p>

<p>An important feature of every task window is the partitioning into frames
and folders. Ideally the protocol frame at the top of the window presents
the user with easy to understand options to specify exactly want they want
to achieve. The file frame requires the user to select input and output
files and select column labels from MTZ files. Each subsequent folder contains
closely related options and the folder has a title indicating the contents
of the folder. Folders which contain less frequently required options are
closed. I try to work towards a convention of putting 'compulsory' options
in the first folder and having all other folders closed - this is not always
possible.</p>

<p>To open a task window requires the command <tt>CreateTaskWindow</tt>
- the arguments to this command include the title and icon name for the
window. The command also requires an id for the window - this is usually
<em><tt>.taskname</tt></em> and the name of the array which contains the
parameters for this task. The name of the array is saved by the library
and used by other commands such as <tt>CreateLine</tt>.</p>

<p>The titles of the folders within the task window are specified by the
fourth argument to <tt>CreateTaskWindow</tt>. All task windows are drawn
with a protocol and a file frame - the additional folders are optional.
To begin the definition of the contents of each frame/folder you must call
<tt>OpenFolder</tt> with the argument 'protocol' or 'file' or an integer
in the range 1 to <em>n</em> where <em>n</em> is the number of folders defined
using the <tt>CreateTaskWindow</tt> command. It is not necessary to call
<tt>OpenFolder</tt> for the folders in the order they appear in the window
so reordering the folders in a window can be done without moving around
large chunks of code.</p>

<p>The <tt>OpenFolder</tt> command has three possible optional commands to
control the default visibility of a folder:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>open</strong></dt>
<dd>the title line and contents of the folder are visible</dd>
<dt><strong>closed</strong></dt>
<dd>the title line of the folder is displayed but the contents
are not displayed. The user can access the contents using the toggle button
on the title line</dd>
<dt><strong>hide</strong></dt>
<dd>neither the title line nor the contents are displayed</dd>
</dl>

<p>The visibility status can be dependent on a control parameter which
would usually be an option in the protocol frame.</p>

<p>There are several commands which draw a single line within a folder.
The most generic command is <tt>CreateLine</tt>. The <tt>CreateInputFileLine</tt>
and <tt>CreateOutputFileLine</tt> commands draw a line for the user to
select a file. The <tt>CreateLabin</tt> command draws a line for the user
to select an MTZ label. All of these commands have arguments which are
the names of parameters. Each parameter must be defined in the .def file.
It is a common mistake for a parameter to be missing from the .def file
and an error message will appear in the report window of the CCP4i main
window (hint: watch this window when you are testing a new interface!)
and the line will not be drawn completely.</p>

<p>The 'line' routines will draw the appropriate widget for the user to
select or enter a value for the parameter. As explained above, all the parameters
for one task interface are stored in one array so commands such as <tt>CreateLine</tt>
are actually drawing widgets which are associated with an array variable
such as <tt>array(PARAM)</tt> but you do not need to be concerned
about this - you just need to give the parameter name <tt>PARAM</tt> as
an argument to the command.</p>

<p>The <tt>CreateLine</tt> command has a very flexible argument list.
Usually arguments come in pairs; each pair is a keyword followed by another
keyword-specific argument. For example the keyword <tt>label</tt> is followed
by the text which is to appear as a label on the line. The keyword <tt>widget</tt>
is followed by the name of a parameter. The appropriate widget (menu
or entry field or toggle button) will be drawn for the type of the parameter
which must have been defined in the <em>taskname.def</em> file.
The <tt>CreateLine</tt> command can have a variable number of keyword arguments
so the line seen by the user can be made up of any combination of label
text and input widgets. The labels and widgets are drawn from left to right
in the order of the keywords in the argument list. <tt>CreateLine</tt>
also has other keywords which define the target for help and the help message
line associated with the subsequent widgets in the line.</p>

<p>It is also possible to control the visibility of individual lines.
<tt>CreateLine</tt> has a keyword <tt>toggle_display</tt> and the other
'line' commands have an optional argument <tt>-toggle_display</tt> which
can make the display of the line dependent on some control parameter. It
is not possible to control the visibility of individual labels and widgets
in a line. Instead you should define the alternative forms of the line
by multiple calls to <tt>CreateLine</tt> and use the <tt>toggle_display</tt>
keyword to control the visibility of each instance of the line.</p>

<p>If you want to group together several consecutive lines and
control their visibility collectively, then use the <tt>OpenSubFrame</tt>
and <tt>CloseSubFrame</tt> commands to group the lines together. The
<tt>OpenSubFrame</tt> command has similar arguments to <tt>OpenFolder</tt>
to define visibility. It is recommended to use these sub-frames wherever
possible, because it makes for faster and smoother updating of a window.</p>

<p>It is very strongly recommended that you use the tools to control visibility
to ensure that once the user has entered what they want to do within the
protocol frame, they are only faced with relevant options. A convention
which I aim towards is that the visibility of a line can only be altered
by a parameter in the protocol frame or in the same folder and appearing
above the line in question. Visibility of folders should only be controlled
by parameters in the protocol frame. These conventions are intended to
avoid a 'jack-in-the-box' effect for the user.</p>

<h3><a name="menus"></a>Menus</h3>

<h4><a name="menu_data_types"></a>Menu Data Types</h4>

<p>All parameters in a task interface must have a data type which is defined
in the .def file. There are many generic data types (<em>e.g.</em> <em>_logical</em>,
<em>_pdb_file</em>, <em>_space_group</em>) which are defined in the <em>types.def</em>
file but some parameters are best represented in the task interface window by a menu
which is specific for the particular task interface. Each menu is treated as a data type
equivalent to <em>_logical</em> or <em>_space_group</em> because, like the
more generic data types, it defines what appears in the task interface
window and determines what the allowed input values are.</p>

<h4><a name="defining_a_menu"></a>Defining a Menu</h4>

<p>Each menu must be given a data type name. To avoid possible clashes,
the name should begin with the task name. For example, in the
<a href="window_demo.html" target="_self"><em>demo</em> task</a>,
the two menu data types are <em>_demo_refine_type</em> and <em>_demo_input_phase</em>.
Note that the data type name always begins with an underscore. The
parameter which has the menu data type is defined in the <em>demo.def</em>
file with a line which has the form:</p>

<pre>
REFINE_TYPE _demo_refine_type FULL
</pre>

<p>Here <tt>REFINE_TYPE</tt> is the parameter which has the data type
<tt>_demo_input_phase</tt> and its initial value is <tt>FULL</tt>.</p>

<p>Each menu is a separate data type but all belong to the <em>menu</em>
class of data types. All data types of the <em>menu</em> class have two properties:
<em>deflist</em> and <em>aliaslist</em> (I regret the choice of names but
not enough to change them). The <em>deflist</em> is the list of options which
the user will see in the task interface window. The text for each item
in the <em>deflist</em> must be 'plain English' for the user to understand
but CCP4 programs usually expect single keywords (and the CCP4i programmer
may prefer to handle single keywords). So the <em>aliaslist</em> is a list
of single word items with one item for each of the items in the <em>deflist</em>.
The <em>aliaslist</em> usually consists of the program input keywords.
The <em>aliaslist</em> is optional - if it is missing, the <em>deflist</em>
item will be used wherever the <em>aliaslist</em> is expected.</p>

<p>Note that where the initial value of the parameter is set in the .def
file, either a <em>deflist</em> or an <em>aliaslist</em> item may be used. It
is usually easier to use the <em>aliaslist</em> item and probably safer as
the text of the <em>deflist</em> is liable to change as you review and refine
the interface.</p>

<p>It is possible to define menus in the <em>types.def</em> file but is more
convenient to call the <em>DefineMenu</em> command in the <em>task.tcl</em>
file. The definition must be within the procedure <em>task</em>_setup (as
described
<a href="#taskname_setup" target="_self">above</a>).</p>

<p>For example in the <em>demo.tcl</em> file a menu is defined:</p>

<pre>
DefineMenu _demo_refine_type \
[list &quot;full refinement&quot; &quot;quick refinement&quot;] \
[list FULL FAST]
</pre>

<p>The three arguments to
<tt><a href="DefineMenu.html" target="_self"><em>DefineMenu</em></a></tt>
are:</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>menu_name</em></dt><dd><tt>_demo_refine_type</tt></dd>
<dt><em>deflist</em></dt><dd><tt>[list &quot;full refinement&quot;
&quot;quick refinement&quot;]</tt></dd>
<dt><em>aliaslist</em></dt><dd><tt>[list FULL FAST]</tt></dd>
</dl>

<p>Two features of Tcl syntax to note here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>strings which contain spaces must be enclosed in double quotes <em>e.g.</em>
&quot;full refinement&quot;</li>
<li>the safest way to define a list in Tcl is to use the <em>list</em> command
which, in this context, must have square brackets enclosing the command
name and its arguments. See also
<a href="http://sunscript.sun.com/man/tcl8.1/TclCmd/list.htm" target="_blank">Tcl
<em>list</em> command</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="variable_menus"></a>Variable Menus</h4>

<p>A variable menu is one which may change as the interface is used. For
example, look at the <strong><tt>Directories&amp;ProjectDir</tt></strong> window
(accessed by clicking the button on the top right of the CCP4i main window). In
this window, as the user adds extra project directories, the menu for selecting
the default project directory is extended.</p>

<p><font color="#ff0000">This needs more documentation</font></p>

<h3><a name="extending_and_toggle_frames"></a>Extending Frames and Toggle Frames</h3>

<p>To understand what these are, look at examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Cad interface has an extending frame in the file frame to allow
users to enter the names of one or more input files.</li>
<li>The Refmac interface uses toggle frames to define the domains in rigid
body refinement. To see these, bring up the Refmac task window and change
the refinement mode (the first menu in the protocol frame) to 'rigid body
refinement'. Now look down the window to the 'Rigid Domains Definition'
folder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both extending frames and toggle frames have two control buttons underneath
them. The button on the right, which has a context-dependent label and allows
the user to open an extra frame beneath those which might already be open.
And the button on the left is a menubutton with access to some simple editing
functionality to delete and copy frames. Extending frames are usually just
single line frames but can have more than one line. Toggle frames are
usually multi-line frames which also have a title line with a toggle button
which controls the display of the frame contents. Note that closing a frame
does not make the contents 'go away' or switch them off!</p>

<p>It is possible to nest extending frames inside either other extending
frames or inside toggle frames. Only one layer of nesting is allowed and
it is not currently possible to have toggle frames nested within extending
or toggle frames. An example is in the Cad interface. If, for one of the
input files, you choose to 'Select Input Columns', an extending frame
to select MTZ columns is displayed. This 'select label' extending
frame is embedded within a 'select file' extending frame.</p>

<p>These frames are defined using the <tt>CreateExtendingFrame</tt> and
<tt>CreateToggleFrame</tt> commands. It is also necessary to write a separate
procedure which defines the content of each frame. Each time the user clicks
the control button to open another frame, the procedure is invoked to draw
the contents of the frame. The name of the procedure is an argument to
<tt>CreateExtendingFrame</tt> or <tt>CreateToggleFrame</tt>. The procedure
must have certain defined arguments so that some possibly useful information
can be passed to the procedure. The arguments are the array name and the
value of a counter which will be '1' if this is the first frame to be drawn,
'2' if it is the second frame and so on. If the frame is a nested extending
frame, two counters are passed to the procedure. The first counter
is for the 'outer' frame and the second counter is for the nested extending
frame.</p>

<p>Any parameter which is used inside an extending frame or toggle frame
only needs to appear once in the <em>taskname.def</em> file. If the root
of the parameter name is <tt>PARAM</tt>, the defining line in the .def
file should be for <tt>PARAM,0</tt>, <em>i.e.</em> the root name followed
by a comma and zero. I think of this as the zero'th instance of <tt>PARAM</tt>
which will always contain the initial default value for <tt>PARAM</tt> so
that whenever a new extending or toggle frame is opened, it will have a
parameter <tt>PARAM,<em>n</em></tt> which initially takes the same value
as <tt>PARAM,0</tt>.</p>

<p><em>Parameter names must not contain commas. Even if Tcl/Tk can handle
them, they will confuse CCP4i!</em></p>

<p>The contents of each extending or toggle frame is defined within a separate
procedure which uses commands such as <tt>CreateLine</tt>. Within the procedure
commands which require a parameter name as an argument (<em>e.g.</em> after the
<tt>widget</tt> keyword in the <tt>CreateLine</tt> command) just
require the root name of the parameter. Appropriate indices will be added
internally.</p>

<p>Each extending frame and toggle frame has an index parameter which keeps
count of the number of frames opened. This parameter needs to be defined
in the .def file. It usually has a type <em>_positiveint</em> and is initialised
as zero. The name of the parameter is given as an argument to the
<tt>CreateExtendingFrame</tt> or <tt>CreateToggleFrame</tt> commands. The user
must NOT have access to this parameter in any other part of the interface!</p>

<p>When the user clicks the <strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> button, a new script
is created to run the task as an independent process. In this run script, the
parameters are no longer bundled into one array. The parameters which can potentially
have multiple instances because they occur in extending and toggle frames,
are converted to arrays which have the form <tt>PARAM(i)</tt> or (where they are
from nested extending frames) <tt>PARAM(i,j)</tt>. Note that the convention for
the ordering of the indices is that the second index is for the nested
loop (this is the reverse of what you might expect by analogy with the
Fortran convention).</p>

<p>Internal to CCP4i, there are alternative conventions for naming parameters
which appear in extending and toggle frames. These are discussed below
- you can probably
<a href="#project_database_parameters"
target="_self">skip this discussion</a>.</p>

<p>Any parameter which appears in an extending or toggle frame can have
multiple instances. For example, in the Cad interface there may be multiple
HKLIN parameters. The obvious way to handle these would be to have
an array called HKLIN with indices 1 to <em>n</em> where <em>n</em> is
the number of files. But this is not possible because HKLIN itself
is the name of element of the array which contains all of the Cad parameters.
So the way this is handled in the graphical part of CCP4i, is to call the
parameters HKLIN,1 HKLIN,2 ... HKLN,<em>n</em> <em>etc</em>. Note that these
parameter names are really the names of elements in an array so the variables
are really <tt>array(HKLIN,1)</tt>, <tt>array(HKLIN,2)</tt> <em>etc</em>.
Remember the comment made earlier that Tcl arrays are not truly
multidimensional; Tcl treats the comma in these array element names as just
another character but CCP4i does handle such parameters differently in some
circumstances.</p>

<p>An extended frame embedded within another frame contains parameters which
need to have two indices. So for example in the Cad interface, if two labels
are selected for the first file they are given parameter names:
<tt>LABIN,1_1</tt>, <tt>LABIN,1_2</tt>. Note the use of an underscore to
separate the two indices (I now regret not using a comma but not enough to
change it). The index before the underscore is the index for the outer loop
(the file) and the index after the underscore is the index for inner loop
(the labels). Note that this is the reverse of the Fortran convention for
indices order.</p>

<p>There are utility commands to parse these complex parameters: GetIndx</p>

<h3><a name="project_database_parameters"></a>Parameters Used by the Project Database</h3>

<p>Besides the parameters required to run the task, there are three parameters
which should be defined for every task which will be used by the database:
<tt>INPUT_FILES</tt>, <tt>OUTPUT_FILES</tt> and <tt>TITLE</tt>. These three
parameters should be defined in the .def file (see the <em>demo.def</em> file)
but only the <tt>TITLE</tt> parameter should appear on the interface.
<tt>INPUT_FILES</tt> and <tt>OUTPUT_FILES</tt> are lists of the
input file parameters and output file parameters respecively. For example,
for a Refmac-like refinement the <tt>INPUT_FILES</tt> might be the list
&quot;HKLIN XYZIN&quot; and the <tt>OUTPUT_FILES</tt> might be the list
&quot;HKLOUT XYZOUT&quot;.
When a task is run, the database saves the names of the files stored in
the variables <tt>HKLIN</tt>, <tt>XYZIN</tt>, <tt>HKLOUT</tt> and
<tt>XYZOUT</tt> and so has a record of the
input and output files for the task. Beware that the input and output file
list often depend on the mode of running the program so that it may be
necessary to update the lists in the <em>taskname_run</em> procedure in the task
window file.</p>

<p>The <tt>TITLE</tt> parameter should be defined in the .def file and should
appear as the first line of the protocol frame in the task window. The
text from the <tt>TITLE</tt> parameter is saved in the database and written
to the Job List in the main window. If the program has a <tt>TITLE</tt> keyword,
it is expected to use the same parameter. The task should have a <tt>TITLE</tt>
parameter even if the program does not have a <tt>TITLE</tt> keyword.</p>

<h3><a name="MTZ_column_labels"></a>Handling of MTZ Column Labels</h3>

<h4><a name="taskname_run"></a>The <em>taskname_run</em> Procedure</h4>

<p>It is not necessary to define a procedure <em>taskname_run</em> in a task window
file but if it is defined, it will be called when the user clicks the
<strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> button before a run script is written. Any
'tidying up' of parameters should be done in this procedure. There are several
parameters which particularly might need tidying up.</p>

<dl>
<dt><tt>INPUT_FILES</tt> and <tt>OUTPUT_FILES</tt></dt>
<dd>CCP4i expects every task to have parameters <tt>INPUT_FILES</tt> and
<tt>OUTPUT_FILES</tt> which are necessary for the project database to save
the names of input and output files correctly. The input and output files
for a task often depend on the mode of running and these parameters might
need to be updated after the user has set the run mode and just before
the job is actually run.</dd>
<dt><tt>LABIN</tt> (or similar lists of MTZ column labels)</dt>
<dd>In CCP4i the <tt>LABIN</tt> parameter is usually a list of the MTZ input
column label parameters. The <tt>LABIN</tt> parameter is used by the
<tt>LABELLIST</tt> keyword
in the command template files to generate the <tt>LABIN</tt> keyword in the
program command file. The required MTZ input columns are often dependent
on the mode of running the task and so the <tt>LABIN</tt> might need to be
updated after the user has set the run mode and just before the job is
actually run.</dd>

<h3><a name="prerequisites"></a>Handling Prerequisites for Running Tasks</h3>

<h4><a name="taskname_prereq"></a>The <em>taskname_prereq</em> Procedure</h4>

<p>It is not necessary to define a procedure <em>taskname_prereq</em> in a task
window file however if it is defined, it will be called whenever the main
interface tries to determine whether the task should be made available to the
user from the task list in the main window.</p>

<p>The procedure should perform any necessary checks, for example checking
whether a particular executable is available on the user's path, to ensure that
the task can be run. It should return 1 if the prerequisites are met (i.e. the
task can be run), and zero otherwise.</p>

<p>For tasks where the prerequisites are not met, the button to launch the
task will be non-functioning and the text will be displayed as "greyed-out".
Also the message line text with the task description will have the text
"(disabled)" appended to indicate that the task is not available.</p>
