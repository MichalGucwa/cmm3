<h3><a name="overview_of_files_required"></a>Overview of Files Required for a Task Interface</h3>

<p>To write an interface to a single task you will normally need to create
four files - their format and function is introduced by some simple examples
below. It is necessary to give these files the right names and put them
in the right directories for the main Interface program to find them.</p>

<p>The example used throughout this overview is for a task called <em>fiddleit</em>
which is an interface to a single program called <em>fiddleprog</em>. You
can look at this task interface by typing the command:</p>

<p><strong>&gt; ccp4i -task fiddleit</strong></p>

<p>The <em>fiddleit</em> task interface will be displayed. If you enter
some parameters and then choose <strong><tt>Run&amp;View Com File</tt></strong> from the
<strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> menu at the bottom left of the task window, you will see the
program command line and command file that is created. You should then
<strong><tt>Abort</tt></strong> rather than try to run the program, as a <em>fiddleprog</em>
program does not exist.</p>

<h4><a name="command_template"></a>The Command Template File</h4>

<p>A <a href="command_template.html" target="_self">full description</a> of
the command template file can be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>CCP4 programs expect most of their input in a keyworded command file.
The Interface uses a command template file to generate
a command file. The format of this template file has been devised for the
CCP4Interface - it is <strong>not</strong> Tcl.</p>

<p>The command template contains the keywords and names of parameters required
by the program. The parameter values will be automatically substituted
into the template when the user runs the task. The command template also has
a simple control language (<em>i.e.</em> it allows IFs, ELSEs and loops <em>etc.</em>)
which is necessary for all but the simplest of program input. Look, for example,
at <em>$CCP4I_top/templates/fft.com</em> in conjunction with the
<a href="../../../../html/fft.html" target="_PROGDOC">documentation</a>
for the FFT program.</p>

<p>Assume the program <em>fiddleprog</em> expects the following keywords:</p>
<dl>
<dt><pre>
title &lt;title&gt;
fiddlefactors &lt;factor_1&gt; &lt;factor_2&gt; [&lt;factor_3&gt;]
</pre></dt>
<dd><em>i.e.</em> the keyword <tt>title</tt> followed by some parameter called
<tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt>, and the keyword <tt>fiddlefactors</tt> followed by parameters
<tt>&lt;factor_1&gt; &lt;factor_2&gt;</tt> and optionally <tt>&lt;factor_3&gt;</tt>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The command template is then called <em>$CCP4I_top/templates/fiddleprog.com</em>
and contains a few lines which look like this:</p>

<pre>
1 title $TITLE
1 fiddlefactors $FACTOR_1 $FACTOR_2
- $EXTRA_FIDDLE&nbsp;$FACTOR_3
</pre>

<p>The format is explained fully
<a href="command_template.html" target="_self">later</a> but note the
following two important features:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a line begins with a '-' it is a continuation of the previous line</li>

<li>The first, non '-', word on a line is a logical value which determines
if the line is written to the command file. If the logical is 'true' (or&nbsp;1)
the line is written; if the logical is 'false' (or&nbsp;0) the line is not written.</li>
</ul>

<p>Assume the user has set the following parameters (<em>via</em> the Interface):</p>

<dl>
<dt><pre>
set TITLE &quot;This should be a really good fiddle&quot;
set FACTOR_1 0.1
set FACTOR_2 400
set FACTOR_3 27.1
set EXTRA_FIDDLE 1
</pre></dt>
<dd><em>Note</em>: EXTRA_FIDDLE&nbsp;is set to 1 or 'true'</dd>
</dl>
<p>Then these values will be substituted into the template to generate the
following command file:</p>

<pre>
title&nbsp;'This should be a really good fiddle'
fiddlefactors 0.1 400 -
27.1
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Note that the '-' character on the end of the second line is the usual
CCP4 line continuation character</li>

<li>If the parameter EXTRA_FIDDLE had been zero (<em>i.e.</em> 'false')
the final line containing the parameter FACTOR_3, and the dash on the second
line, would not have been written to the command file.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="work_file"></a>The Work Script File</h4>

<p>A <a href="run_scripts.html" target="_self">full description</a> of
work files can be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>The work file contains the functionality which is invoked when the user
hits the <strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> button on the task window. The work file is
written in Tcl which is an excellent language to use when you need to write complex
scripts. For a simple case where one task corresponds to running one program,
the work file can be very simple. For our example it could contain:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
CreateComScript $CCP4I_top/templates/fiddleprog.com fp_script

Execute &quot;fiddleprog HKLIN&nbsp;datain.mtx HKLOUT&nbsp;fiddleddata.mtz&quot; \
      $fp_script $LOG_FILE&nbsp;program_status report
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This script just calls the commands <em>CreateComScript</em> and
<em>Execute</em>.<br /><em>N.B.</em> the backslash at the end of the second
line is the line continuation character in Tcl scripts.</p>

<p>The command <em>CreateComScript</em> uses the command template file (as described
<a href="#command_template" target="_self">above</a>) to
generate a useable program command file, substituted with
the parameters from the Interface (how this is done is described
<a href="#how_parameters_get" target="_self">later</a>).
The command has two arguments: the name of the command template
file is input, and the name of a temporary program command file is returned.</p>

<p>The command <em>Execute</em> will run a CCP4 program (or any other program)
using the command line which is given as its first argument . Note that,
as is usual with CCP4 programs, this command line includes the definition
of the input and output files, HKLIN and HKLOUT.</p>

<p>The second argument to this command is the name of the temporary file
which contains the keyworded input generated by <em>CreateComScript</em>.
The remaining arguments will be described in
<a href="command_template.html" target="_self">more detail later</a>.</p>

<p>If the task is an interface to multiple programs, the work file
will become more complex as it will usually have some flow control and
may have to perform functions such as extracting information from log files.
For two of the more complex examples look at <em>$CCP4I_top/scripts/fft.script</em>
and <em>$CCP4I_top/scripts/patterson.script</em>.</p>

<p>CCP4i provides a <a href="indexframeset.html" target="_PROGRAMMERSDOCS">library
of commands</a> which could be useful in a work file, including <em>CreateComScript</em>
and <em>Execute</em>, but someone writing a complex script may need to be
familiar with some basic Tcl commands - particularly for control structures
(<em>i.e.</em> IFs and loops <em>etc.</em>).</p>

<h4><a name="def_file"></a>The <strong>.def</strong> File</h4>

<p>A <a href="def_files.html" target="_self">more detailed description</a>
of the <strong>.def</strong> file can be found elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <strong>.def</strong> file defines the type and initial value for the parameters.
A file of similar format is used to save parameters if the user picks the
<strong><tt>Save Parameters</tt></strong> option at the bottom of the task window.</p>

<p>For our example the <strong>.def</strong> file
<em>$CCP4I_top/tasks/fiddleit.def</em> is:</p>

<pre>
#CCP4I VERSION CCP4Interface 1.0
#CCP4I SCRIPT&nbsp;DEF fiddleit
#CCP4I DATE 25/06/97
#CCP4I USER&nbsp;lizp
TITLE _text &quot;&quot;
FACTOR_1 _fraction 0.1
FACTOR_2 _positiveint 200
FACTOR_3 _real 20.0
EXTRA_FIDDLE _logical 0
</pre>

<p>The file identifiers, in lines beginning #CCP4I, which appear at the
top of all <strong>.def</strong> files, are important to ensure the file is recognised and
not used inappropriately.</p>

<p>In the subsequent lines the parameters required by the program are defined.</p>

<p>TITLE&nbsp;is defined as type _text with an initial value of
&quot;&quot;&nbsp;(<em>i.e.</em> an empty string), FACTOR_1 is of type _fraction and has
initial value 0.1 <em>etc</em>.</p>

<h4><a name="tcl_file"></a>The Tcl File</h4>

<p>For our example the tcl file has the name <em>$CCP4I_top/tasks/fiddleit.tcl</em>.
This file is written in Tcl and contains the code to generate the graphical
interface.</p>

<p>CCP4i provides a library of commands to create the graphical window
and most task windows can be created using just a handful of commands with
minimal 'raw' Tcl. For example, to create the input widgets for the parameters
in our example requires:</p>

<pre>
CreateLine line \
     message &quot;Enter a title for this job (TITLE)&quot; \
     label &quot;Title&quot; \
     widget TITLE -width 80
CreateLine line \
     message &quot;Enter the fiddle factors (FIDDLEFACTORS)&quot; \
     label &quot;Fiddle factors: first&quot; \
     widget FACTOR_1 \
     label &quot;second&quot; \
     widget FACTOR_2
CreateLine line \
     message &quot;Use extra fiddle factor for really rough problem \
     (FIDDLEFACTORS FACTOR_3)&quot; \
     widget EXTRA_FIDDLE \
     label &quot;Use third fiddle factor&quot; \
     widget FACTOR_3
</pre>

<p>Here the command <em>CreateLine</em> has been used three times to create
three lines in the task window. Note that the backslash at the end of lines
is the line continuation character, so each call to the command has a long
argument list but it has been laid out in this fashion to simplify reading.
The <em>CreateLine</em> command has very flexible arguments - the only fixed
argument is the first one (<tt>line</tt>) which returns an identifier for the
line which is created. The remaining arguments to the command usually come in
pairs - a keyword and a parameter:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong><tt>message</tt></strong></dt><dd>followed by a short line of help
text which will appear in the message line when the user puts the mouse
over any of the widgets in the line.</dd>
<dt><strong><tt>label</tt></strong></dt><dd>followed by the text which the
user will see on the task window.</dd>
<dt><strong><tt>widget</tt></strong></dt><dd>followed by the name of a parameter
which must have been defined in the def file. This keyword will create
either a menu or a button or an entry field (that is a field for the user
to type in a parameter) dependent on the data type (defined in the def
file) for the parameter. For all the parameters <tt>TITLE, FACTOR_1, FACTOR_2</tt>
and <tt>FACTOR_3</tt> a simple entry field will be created with the initial
value set to the initial value given in the def file. The widget for
<em>EXTRA_FIDDLE</em>, which has data type <tt>_logical</tt>, will be different:
it will be a small checkbutton.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some keywords have optional extra parameters. In the first
call to <tt>CreateLine</tt> in the example above, the keyword-parameter
pair '<tt>widget TITLE</tt>' is followed by the extra parameter '<tt>-width
80</tt>', which specifies that this field must be 80 characters wide.</p>

<p>Most of the commands used to define the task window have a similar form
- they return an identifier and have some fixed arguments and several optional
arguments which have keywords beginning with a '-' character.</p>

<h3><a name="how_parameters_get"></a>How Parameters Get from Interface to Program</h3>

<p>The above descriptions of the different files do not really explain
how the parameters get passed from the task window to the program. Here
is a quick explanation.</p>

<p>When the user clicks the <strong><tt>Run</tt></strong> button, the Interface
creates a new script file called a <strong>.run</strong> file in the user's scratch
directory. You should run a simple task and then look at the file with the extension
.run in your scratch directory. At the top of the run file the values of the parameters
from the task interface are declared. Below these is the script which
has been copied from the work file. The run file is then run as an independent
process. It will generate the program command script(s) and run the program(s).
</p>

<p>The <tt>CreateComScript</tt> command which creates the program command
script does something which may seem impossible to a Fortran programmer:
it can 'see' the values of the parameters although they have not been explicitly
passed to command. It manages to do this by using the <tt>uplevel</tt>
command to see variables at a different level in the stack and so is able
to substitute the values declared in the run script into the command template
file.</p>

<h3><a name="how_tasks_are_run"></a>How Tasks are Run</h3>

<p>When the user opts to run a task, the main ccp4i process does the following:
<ul>
<li>Saves the parameters set up for the task; to a <strong>.def</strong> file in the
CCP4_DATABASE directory for the current project</li>
<li>Start a completely separate process (usually referred to as the <em>run</em>
process).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The run process then:
<ul>
<li>Reads a small library of utility procedures which can subsequently be used
by the script which controls the running of the program(s).</li>
<li>Sends a message to the original ccp4i process to say that the job is RUNNING</li>
<li>Reads the parameters from the saved .def file</li>
<li>Sources the appropriate script file for the task:
$CCP4I_top/scripts/<em>taskname</em>.script.
This script controls the running of the program(s) and will be referred
to as the <em>task</em> script.</li>
<li>When the script complete, sends a message to the original ccp4i process
to say that the job has finished.</li>
<li>Terminates the process</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="task_script"></a>The Task Script</h4>

<p>The script which controls the running of a particular task is
$CCP4I_top/scripts/<em>taskname</em>.script.
For the simplest case of running just one program, this script might be
only one or two lines long but it can potentially be much longer and run
several programs, extract data from files and do significant processing
of the data. The script is written in Tcl (but with no Tk which
is the X-windows graphical part of Tcl/Tk). There is a library of
utilities available to the task script and a simple script will need to
use just one or two of the utility procedures and the programmer will
need to know only very minimal Tcl.</p>

<p>Most CCP4 programs expect both command line input (which usually specifies
the input and output file names) and some additional commands which, when
running from a script, can be piped in or read from a command file.
CCP4i currently works by writing a temporary command file for each program
that the script runs.</p>

<p>A simple example to run the program <em>demoprog</em> which assumes that
the parameters HKLIN, HKLOUT, RESOLUTION and MODE have been set:

<blockquote>
<pre>
set comfile [GetTmpFileName -ext com]
WriteFile $comfile \
       &quot/mode $MODE
         reso $RESOLUTION&quot;

Execute &quot;demoprog hklin $HKLIN hklout $HKLOUT&quot;
$comfile program_status report
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In this script the first line calls the utility procedure <em>GetTmpFileName</em>
to assign a name for a temporary command file, <em>comfile</em>. This
utility return a file name which includes the users project name and job
id the arguments <em>-ext com</em> mean that 'com' is included in
the file name to identify the file as a command file.
<br />The next three lines call the procedure <em>WriteFile</em> which will
write to the file <em>comfile</em> the short command script enclosed in double
quotation marks.
<br />The final line of the script actually runs the program using the <em>Execute</em>
procedure. The procedure does more than just run the program - it
should handle program failures, puts output to the log file, and
it can display the command script to the user and allow editing before
running the program. The arguments to the <em>Execute</em> command are: the
command line which is enclosed in double quotation marks, and the name of the
command file <em>comfile</em>.</p>
