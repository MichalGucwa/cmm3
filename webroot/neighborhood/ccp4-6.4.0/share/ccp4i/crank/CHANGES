CHANGES
-------

Version 1.4
-----------

* Release of multicomb for multivariate phase combination in density modification for SAD experiments
* Release of afro with multivariate FA calculation for SAD experiments
* Changes in ccp4i interface

Version 1.3 (Released 17 February 2009)
-----------

* Significantly faster bp3.
* Much cleaner logfiles that are baubles compliant.

Version 1.2 (Released in CCP4 version 6.1)
-----------

* Added interface to Coot, Buccaneer, ResolveDM, ResolveMB.
* Added "CUSTOM" pipeline in CCP4i.
* Works under windows.
* Works with version 5.5 of Refmac (including the SAD function).
* Minor bug fixes.

Version 1.1 (Released 14 February 2007)
-----------

* Added interface to pirate (http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/)
* Crank no longer runs UNIX shell scripts, but tcl scripts for
  compatibility with windows.
* BP3 with SAD data is significantly faster.
* Minor bug fixes and changes to ccp4i interface.
* Can run crank starting from substructure phasing (ie. inputting
  substructure coordinates).


Version 1.0  (Released 20 November 2006)
-----------

* Using density modification to attempt to determine number of monomers 
  in the asymmetric unit and optimizing solvent content.
* Substructure verification in CRUNCH2 using bp3 for SAD and MAD.

Version 0.9.75  (Released 10 August 2006)
--------------

* Support for automated model building with ARP/wARP + REFMAC.
* Support for density modification with SOLOMON.
* Crank and bp3 support for SAD, SIR(AS) and MAD experiments.
* Completely re-written crank with Default, SHELX[C/D/E]-ARP/wARP, 
  SHELXC-SHELXD-SHELXE-BP3-SOLOMON-ARP/wARP pipelines.
* Beta version of program gcx to run crank via script.
* Fast-phasing in bp3 which can be significantly faster and produce
  comparable results.
* New program AFRO for F(A) / E(A) calculation from SAD/MAD or SIRAS
  data sets.
* Input either amplitudes or intensities.

Version 0.9.0
-------------

* The crank in CCP4 v 6.0.0 with support for SAD and SIR(AS) experiments
* Similar to crank 0.8.1, but with no support from crunch2.


Version 0.8.1 (Released 11 January 2005)
-------------

* Crank support for SAD and SIR(AS) experiments.
